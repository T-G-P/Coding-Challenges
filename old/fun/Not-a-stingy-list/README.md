NOT A STINGY LIST
=================

Here we have a script that I hope to ultimately use as a first step for providing an alternate viewing experience to the
traditional craigslist search. Typically, you are only able to search for things on craigslist on a city by city basis.

I personally have spent hours in the past searching every city for cars using tools such as Search Tempest, but now I am able to generate
the the results for any query countrywide. I sort the result by city and by most recent time posted.

A few years ago craiglook.com accomplished this task but was taken down due to violation of the terms of Craigslist. Since there
currently aren't any tools that do exactly what I need, I periodically use this script to get the most recent results for the car
that I have been searching for.

TODO:
1) Improve performance
2) Add caching layer of some sort
3) finish flask app or start over with Django.
