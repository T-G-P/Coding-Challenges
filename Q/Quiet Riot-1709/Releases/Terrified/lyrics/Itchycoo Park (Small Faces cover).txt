Over bridge of sighsTo rest my eyes in shades of greenUnder dreamin' spiresTo Itchycoo Park, that's where I've beenWhat did you do there?I got highWhat did you feel there?Well I criedBut why the tears there?I'll tell you whyIt's all too beautifulIt's all too beautifulIt's all too beautifulIt's all too beautifulI feel inclined to blow my mindGet hung up feed the ducks with a bunThey all come out to groove aboutBe niceand have fun in the sunTell you what I'll do (what will you do?)I'd like to go there now with youYou can miss out school (won't that be cool)Why go to learn the words of fools?What will we do there?We'll get highWhat will we touch there?We'll touch the skyBut why the tears then?I'll tell you whyIt's all too beautifulIt's all too beautifulIt's all too beautifulIt's all too beautifulI feel inclined to blow my mindGet hung up feed the ducks with a bunThey all come out to groove aboutBe nice and have fun in the sunIt's all too beautifulIt's all too beautifulIt's all too beautifulHa! It's all too beautiful
