In the night of the day I was bornQuite sure I wouldn't see no tomorrowAll the days I was wasting aloneAlways waiting for the nights without sorrowsMister, mister, you don't know what I amCan't you hear it always trembling in my voiceDon't you know I'm doing all that I canBut I'm a man without any choiceEveryday's only pain for meI don't like the sunlight shining on my headI'm a man that was born for the darkEvery light that shines it making me feel badLady, lady, put your had on my headCan't you feel the grieving sorrows in my brain'cause I'm the one who's behaving so badI need those feelings for you againMan of the dark - the guardian of the nightMan of the dark - the guardian of the nightI don't like people working all dayOnly working just to see next tomorrowBut they are happy while they're living that wayIn that world I gotta beg, steal or borrowMister, mister, you don't know what I amCan't you hear it always trembling in my voiceDon't you know I'm doing all that I canBut I'm a man without any choiceMan of the dark - the guardian of the nightMan of the dark - the guardian of the nightOf the night - of the night
