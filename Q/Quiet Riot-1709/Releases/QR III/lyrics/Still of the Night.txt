We're not the ones to blameBurning passions mixed with painPast the point of no returnNothing stays the sameThe streets become our homeRestless souls out on our ownTrapped my ruins made by foolsChasing the unknownIn the still of the nightWith nowhere to turnWe took a roll of the diceAnd we learnAnd in the still of the nightStreets of fire will burnAs we run for our livesTo surviveYeahVoices in the darkCalling us to play a partLittle be known the razor's edgeHave we gone too far?Every chance that we takeThere is a price that must be paidIt's easy come and easy goBut we are here to stayYeah!In the still of the nightWith nowhere to turnWe took a roll of the diceAnd we learnIn the still of the nightStreets of fire will burnAs we run for our livesTo surviveYeahOh!In the still of the night (Of the night)With nowhere to turnWe took a roll of the diceAnd we learnAnd in the still of the nightStreets of fire will burnAs we run, run for our livesTo surviveTo surviveTo surviveAnd where do I turnIn the still of the nightAnd what did I learnIn the still of the nightThe fires still burn, yeahYeah, yeah
