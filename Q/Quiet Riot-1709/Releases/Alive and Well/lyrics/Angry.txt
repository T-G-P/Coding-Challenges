Not a lover not a fighterAlways out of my leagueSometimes maybeLife ain't what it seemsThere's a man in the back saysI gotta keep stillSomeone at the front doorSays just do what you willDo what you will !My ears are ringingWith voices unclearThe sun is settingIs it love or is it fearI'm angryI'm an angry young manWhen love ain't enoughAngry - I'm an angry young manWhen my heart's gettin toughI'm an angry young manYes I am !Running down the alleyOn a hot summer's dayFell in kinda dangerous-troubleOne step awayWell I'm walkin the walkAnd I'm talkin the talkBut when it comes to lovinI'm alone in the darkYes I am !Runnin on empty under the gunThe pressure's buildingThe storm has just begun...AngryI'm an angry young manWhen love ain't enoughAngry - I'm an angry young manWhen my heart's gettin toughAngry I'm an angry young manWhen I can't get enoughI'm an angry young manWhen push comes to shoveI'm an angry young man !Give it to me !I got emotional baggageThat I drag aroundWith all this dirty laundryI gotta get outa townYes I do !Say hello to my demonsI count then as friendsAin't no denyin they'll be here til the end.Cause I'm angry...Angry, angry I feel hopelessAngry angry, I love my face.
