Call of the wild has beenDraggin me downSpirit controls what's inside youTears flow like bloodin a hot open flameA sign of the fire inside youWe gotta give it up - We can't resistWe gotta get away[Chorus]Time stands stillWhen youre having funBut you pay the priceWhen the day is doneKindred spirits come one by oneWhen the day turns blackWe will become-The ritualDown in a holeWhen the sky closes inAnd darkness will fall upon youWalk into the lightTo be free from the spellLet the ritual surround youIs it at the rainbow's endOut in the coldIs just a breath awayTime stands stillWhen youre having funBut you pay the priceWhen the day is doneKindred spirits come one by oneWhen the day turns blackWe will become-The ritualWe couldn't give upWe still persistWe couldn't get away-  no
