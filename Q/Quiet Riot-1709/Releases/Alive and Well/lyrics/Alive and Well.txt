Headin down the wrong wayOn a one way streetLookin for lovebut it ain't lookin for meI feel like a foolBut what do you expectLife is to short to waste on regretsLook at me nowit must be hard to tell...That I'm alive and wellI'm alive and wellAnd I'm here to tellThat I'm alive and wellTen years later and it's all the sameNo reason to bitch but I still complainGod only knows what God only knowsHow can we find the key to it allLookin at me nowit must be hard to tell...Look out !Closer to the truththe harder it seemsHell if I knowwhat it's supposed to meanWith all the struggle that we endureA little bit of faith could be the cureEvery time you think it's allGoing to hell... Remember...I'm alive, you're aliveWe are alive and wellAnd were here to tellThat we're alive and wellA little metal healthIs still alive and wellGet to the point, it won't take longA little bit of faith is gonna carry onThe ride that we take is shorterthan it seemsThe good things in life don't have to stay dreams.
