I can't see the forest from the treesHeadin' straight for a catastropheOne step forward two steps backIs a heart attackI'm going' heard firstNo warning signsOut in the danger zoneEvery single nightThrow my heart against the wallDon't know where I'm goingTake a chance and win it allBreakin' all the rulesLet's throw caution to the windDon't know where it's blowingThrow my heart againstHeart againstHeart against the wallMy head is spinninI can't see straightAnd that's when I'm havinA real good dayWhen the same two musclesIgnore the brainYou gotta follow your heartAnd shive the fateI got more love than senseAnd that ain't no defenseI'm gonna hurt myselfI've been a fool beforeAnd then I closed the doorAnd walked into the wallYes I did !
