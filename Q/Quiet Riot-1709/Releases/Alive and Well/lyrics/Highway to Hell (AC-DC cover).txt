Living easy, living freeSeason ticket on a one-way rideAsking nothing, leave me beTaking everything in my strideDon't need reason, don't need rhymeAin't nothing I would rather doGoing down, party timeMy friends are gonna be there tooI'm on the highway to hellNo stop signs, speed limitNobody's gonna slow me downLike a wheel, gonna spin itNobody's gonna mess me roundHey satan, payed my duesPlaying in a rocking bandHey momma, look at meI'm on my way to the promised landI'm on the highway to hell(don't stop me)And I'm going down, all the way downI'm on the highway to hell
