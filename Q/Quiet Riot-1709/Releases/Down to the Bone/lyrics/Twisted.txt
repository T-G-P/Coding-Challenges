Tied up and twistedWhen trust turns to rustYou only have instinct to count onPassion is fashioned to crash and burnJust when you found someIt's like the sound of falling rainNothing to lose and so much to gainEcstasy or misery, my destiny what will it beTied up and twisted - Screamin' in the nightTied up and twisted - The bark that makes you biteWhoa, tied up and twisted! Whoa, tied up and twisted!If sin is the shoe that fits, we're all born to wear itRestrictions create a conflict for souls who can bear itThe pressure's getting hard to takeSomething's got to give or I'm gonna breakMy purgatory fears, the madness now seems so clearTied up and twisted - Screamin' in the nightTied up and twisted - The bark that makes you biteWhoa, tied up and twisted! Whoa, tied up and twisted!Ecstasy or misery, my destiny what will it beDemented incentive is my main motivationI walk down a rocky road, there is no salvationGonna put it in, gonna pull it outTied up and twisted - Screamin' in the nightTied up and twisted - The bark that makes you biteWhoa! Whoa!Whoa, tied up and twisted!Twisted, twisted, twisted, twistedYeah got me all time dirty yeah, oh yeahYou got me tied up and twisted!
