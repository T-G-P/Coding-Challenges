[Carlos Cavazo - Kevin DuBrow - Frankie Banali]Flying far from the scene of the crime nowNothing more that I want to be part ofGonna break the chains that been holding me downGonna spread my wings and I'll fly nowGonna set my sights on the velvet moonI can hear my train is a comin'I can feel my blood is a boilin'I see my fate on the wings of a cloudWings of a cloud Wings of a cloudWings of a cloudYou can keep your vision of a perfect worldIt's just a matter of time, it's gonna crash and burnShooting stars are gonna be my only friendsIn the wink of an eye I'll be gone nowGonna get it right and none too soonI can hear my train is a comin'I can feel my blood is a boilin'I see my fate on the wings of a cloudWings of a cloudOn the wings of a cloudWings of a cloud, gonna get youGonna break the chains that been holding me downGonna spread my wings and I'll fly nowGonna set my sights on the velvet moonI can hear my train is a comin'I can feel my blood is a boilin'I see my fate on the wings of a cloudWings of a cloudOn the wings of a cloudWings of a cloudI'm gonna get forever in sightGonna hold my soul up to the lightI can ride the windOn the wings of a cloudHere I come baby!Oh babe, thinkOn the wings, on the wings
