[Carlos Cavazo - Kevin DuBrow - Frankie Banali]In the darkness your heart is breaking with no one thereThere's a sadness, you shed a tear but no one caresKeep on running from the shattered dreams you can't repairLook for comfort, your empty life's so hard to bearIn the middle of the night when you think you can't go onCan't you take itIn a broken state of mind, will you make itWhen the waves of loneliness rush to tear your life apartWill they drown youIs it freedom that you wantTake me away, Monday morning breakdownYou can't escape, early warning cryAt the crossroads, the breaking point it all too nearIn your madness, the road to nowhere seems so clearIf every single day brings you closer to the edgeLook around youGet out if you can, do you want toIt's a matter of time and you're gonna draw the lineThat surrounds youWhen you're out on a limb, hold onTake me away, Monday morning breakdownIt's here to stay, early warning cryYou can't escape, that Monday morning breakdownCome on Take meYou can't change the world, you can't change the pastYou can't change your mind, so this one's got to lastIn the middle of the night when you think you can't go onCan't you take itIn a broken state of mind, will you make itWhen the waves of loneliness rush to tear your life apartWill they drown youGotta get out! Gotta get out!Take me away, Monday morning breakdownEarly warning cryYou can't escape, that Monday morning breakdown
