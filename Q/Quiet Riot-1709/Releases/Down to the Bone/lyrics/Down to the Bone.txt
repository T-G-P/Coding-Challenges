[Carlos Cavazo - Kevin DuBrow - Frankie Banali]Let me tell you a story, not gonna take too longJust sit on down and listen under the sunPapa, he was a drinking man, Mama wasn't very strongHe liked whisky and women, drank all night long, all night longThat night he had a nasty feeling, if he stayed in town too longThe life that he'd been leading takes him down to the boneThe moon was full around midnight, the sheriff took myPapa down, down, downHis luck had finally run out and laid him to the ground, yes it didIt's me they blamed for the killingThey knew I owned the smoking gunNo alibi can satisfy, I fear it's hanging time, noIt's time to start 'a running and cross the county lineI hear the 9:15 'a rolling down track number nine, rolling onHear my train a comingThe hounds of doom come a howlingThe bayou's trying to slow me down, down, downBetter keep on moving, stay low to the groundI'm gonna start all over with no misery and no pain, noBut if they track me down, I'll be down to the boneBut if they take my life, I'll be down to the boneDown to the bone, midnight hourIf they take my life, I'll be down to the bone
