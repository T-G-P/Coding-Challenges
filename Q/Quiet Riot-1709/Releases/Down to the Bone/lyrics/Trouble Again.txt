[Carlos Cavazo - Kevin DuBrow - Frankie Banali - Bobby Rondinelli]I hear a black cat moaningIn the middle of the nightLike a smoke stack lightningThat's burning brightI went down to the crossroadsWhere I met a manHe said: I'll show you the wayIf you take my handI ain't superstitious, but maybe I shouldI'd cast a spell on you if I could, if I couldOh no, here it comesLooks like I'm in trouble againBad luck ain't heaven sentLooks like I'm in trouble, trouble againStanding in the shadowsIn the middle of the nightKnee deep in quicksandIt's getting really tightI got a voodoo womanDown Louisiana wayShe said: The devil gonna find youNothing you can do, better get on your wayYou're on the wrong road at the right timeThere's a bad moon on the rise, on the riseOh no, here it comesLooks like I'm in trouble againBad luck ain't heaven sentLooks like I'm in trouble againOh no, here it comesLooks like I'm in trouble againBad luck ain't heaven sentLooks like I'm in trouble, trouble againI'm in trouble, trouble againI don't know when I'll be back again oh noBad luck follows, it never endsThe winding road can't take me homeOh no, here it comesLooks like I'm in trouble againBad luck ain't heaven sentYea get in trouble againThey find do They find don'tLooks like I'm in trouble againLook out It's way a goesLooks like I'm in trouble againVoodoo ahead, witchcraft behindLooks like me and trouble are two of a kindThe die is cast, I can't break the moldTrouble's gonna follow me wherever, wherever I go
