I never felt it comin, but you love in a supernatural wayNow you got me running, babe I'm runnin and I can't get awayAnd I feel like I lost control of my very soul , yes I didDoes it mean that much to you And all the things we've been throughWhat's a poor boy to doAnd I just wanna let you know that I love you(Chorus)Now I'm face to face in the mirrorAnd I see what love has doneLet me tell you my thoughts and my visionsOld Habits, Old Habits Die HardNow I really should have known betterEvery time I look at you I believe you could do no harmSometimes the voice inside my head says get away, get away.You know you live inside my mind, am I cursed am I blessed or am I blind?I never did you no wrong, what am I supposed to do?BrideOver me you must carry onI know what your coming to me you must carry on(Repeat verse 1)
