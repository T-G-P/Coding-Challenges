You sucked religion from my lifeWhen we met I believed you were helltake the knife from my backI know you'll use it againDon't Think Of MeI won't think of youDon't Think Of MeI won't think of youYou don't giveYou just takeYou don't giveYou just breakWe were never friendsa one act playI had to stop pretendingMy heart don't ache since you've been goneIt's like you never leftDon't Think Of MeI won't think of youDon't Think Of MeI won't think of youYou don't giveYou just takeYou don't giveYou just takeBridgeMy time and my money but money ain't love noThe evil within shines without a lightI know what I see and I mean what I say
