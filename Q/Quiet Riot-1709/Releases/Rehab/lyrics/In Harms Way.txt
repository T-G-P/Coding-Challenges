You told me no lies, you talking no evilIt's time to let you goWondering why is it too much trouble I really want to knowI gotta cold fever, I gotta new bag, I got it down in MexicoShould have known better, sugar in the pieI really want to know(Chorus)In Harms way and it feels so goodAnd I don't know which way to turnIn Harms way and it feels so goodNothing more needs to be saidYou been my jailer, took me for a whileBut you weren't built to lastI need a little comfort I got your remedyI really want to knowYou told me no lies , you talking no evilBut it's time to let you go
