Grain of sand, no mans land, I wanna flyFade away, that's okay, I enjoyed the rideIncognito, fireflies, burning up my eyesSanctify or receive a fortune full of liesCover me- Disconnected all the way downI Gotta hold on(Chorus)Beggars and thievesThey won't bring you no peaceBeggars and thievesThey're living on a one way streetStanding on the edge of madnessI look down and what do I seeBeggars and thievesDetour ahead-it pretends to save the dayFull of hope, low on faith, I feel compelled to prayOverwhelmed with emotion, the tea has been brewedIndiscreet and abandoned, I guess I'm pretty well screwedForgive me, feeble minded out of controlBreak down, shakedown(Repeat Chorus)(Bridge)Safe cracker, scene stealer, a thief of the first degreeHeart breakers with no takers What does it mean?Dreaming of at time with no pain, Dreaming of the time when they cameNothing here but faded pictures, kinda smooth with faded textures
