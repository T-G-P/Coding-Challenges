I've been the distance and I've seen it allI've been turned around by love and hateI have resided in my private hellBut I love this life and I live to tell(Chorus)Blind Faith is the cause of the troubleBlind faith what we bleedWhen I was young I didn't realizeThere was hope and fear with no compromiseAnd now I testify before myselfI keep walkin on in my innocenceBridgeI know if you follow me- you get what want, you get what you needSomebody's  got to set you free- you get what want, you get what you needNow don't you give it and learn to breatheYou hear a message now before you leaveYou know the fortune here that you have foundThere ain't no doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it
