Somebody's watching, watching you all the timeSomebody's waiting, waiting for you to lose your mindWishes are like broken glass show the cracks of you pastThought you left it all behindSailing on ship of foolsYou got nothing left to proveHidden from the naked eye(Chorus)Black reign- white lightYour pain- will igniteBlack reign -takes flightYou know it heals as it bitesBlack reign- It's like looking directly at the sunMove my soul and take me to a higher placeLet it go and see the storm face to faceAll the answers are within- the secrets that you see as sinIt's a deal that you make with yourselfIntervene your vanityForget about your sanityWe all have a tale to tell(Chorus)Blot out the rays of the sunDeep in your mind it will comeTake all the things that you've learned
