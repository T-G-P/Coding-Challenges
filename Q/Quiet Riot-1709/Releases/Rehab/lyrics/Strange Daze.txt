Pummeled from the moment you wake a void of confusion 24 hours a dayTwisted reality eternal debate the clouds are flowing something's going to break.Deliver me it will deliver you, faceless masses of Grey and blueThe sky is falling a rain of bloodThe souls are empty above(Chorus)Strange Daze- it's hard to acceptStrange ways- you never expectStrange daze-Nothing makes senseStrange Daze trying to make sense of it allLoss of balance with an axe to grindPeople talking with nothing really on their mindsNo provocation, no sparks to the flameInvestigations with nothing left sayRemember me, I won't remember youDogs are howling over what you doSkin is crawling you embrace your self I'm not feeling too well
