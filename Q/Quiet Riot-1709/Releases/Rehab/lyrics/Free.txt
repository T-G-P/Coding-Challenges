You criticize the way I talk, You can't know how I feel, yeah yeah yeah.I sympathize with your dark nature, you don't know what that takes no no noIt's a matter of time now can't you seeBefore I turn to your dark enemyI hear a voice that's telling me(Chorus)I'm free, free of the drama, free from the karma, free of the beastFree, out of my head free of the dread, the moment we metYou can't invade your tired old demons I won't commiserate no no noYou suck the life out of every room how much can I take I don't knowLike a flower that burns you to the touchIt's so beautiful but takes so muchOf the life inside of me
