Walking 'round the town with nothing to doRock-n-roll ringin' in my earsWhy ajust my mind, just singin' the bluesGot to find a way out of hereIt's not so funnyJust a kid, nobody listens to meAin't got no money to do what I wantSomethin's got to set me freeYou say when you grow up you'll have what you wantAnd everything that you needWhat is the use of having it allIf you listen and never be seenIt's not so funnyJust a kid, nobody listens to meAin't got the money to do what I wantSomethin's got to set me freeIf I could suddenly be olderI'd show them all and bring them down to my sizeMy parents tell me you're not the only oneThere's a lot of kids around like youIf all of us kids got together for funWe'd show you a thing or twoNo no noIt's not so funnyJust a kid, nobody listens to meAin't got no money to do what I wantSomethin's got to set me freeIt's not so funnyJust a kid, nobody listens to meAin't got no money to do what I wantSomethin's got to set me freeIt's not so funnyI ain't got no moneyIt's not so funnyI ain't got no moneyIt's not so funny
