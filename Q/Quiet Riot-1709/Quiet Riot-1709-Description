Formed in 1973 as
Mach 1
and briefly changed name to
Little Women
before settling on
Quiet Riot
in May 1975.

Quiet Riot are considered to be one of the first heavy metal bands to make #1 on top 40 music charts in America as well as other countries with their cover of "Cum On Feel the Noize" by Slade. The band never liked the song but their producer at the time persuaded them to cover it to make a single and the recording heard on the "Metal Health" album shows the first time the band played the song, without any previous rehearsing. Following the success of the single however, it became a staple of their live set.

Quiet Riot officially disbanded on September 19, 2003, but reformed with a new lineup in October 2004.

On Sunday, November 25th of 2007, Kevin DuBrow was found dead in his Las Vegas home of a cocaine overdose. It has been reported that DuBrow died about six days before his body was discovered. Frankie Banali announced in January 2008 that Quiet Riot had disbanded permanently.

In September 2010, Banali reactivated the band with the final touring members before DuBrow's death and new vocalist Mark Huff.
