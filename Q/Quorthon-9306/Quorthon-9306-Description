This is a parallel project from
Bathory
's founder,
Quorthon
. He decided after the release of six Bathory albums that he would like to try something different, showing a totally different side of himself.

On
Album
(1994) he let himself be influenced by heavy metal bands like
Black Sabbath
and Mountain. Also some punk influences were recognizable (Sex Pistols etc.). This album was recorded in a low class studio in two weeks, using only a guitar, a bass and a drum machine.

On
Purity Of Essence
(1997), the second and final full-length of the project, Quorthon decided to experiment more and more, showing his more rocking side. On this record his inspirations were bands like Sex Pistols, The Beatles and other bands like these.
