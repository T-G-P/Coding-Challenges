Quiltera is a brazilian Prog Metal/Prog Rock band formed in 2011 by Yuri Deryous, who was bassist at the time, with the drummer Emerson Sant'anna and Victor Paron and Vinicius Sant'anna on guitars. That same year they released a demo called Bicho Instrumental containing some interpretations of varied instrumental songs, plus two original compositions. 

After some lineup changes and a period focused on composition, the band finally released in March 2014 their first album, Jgmglibtz, recorded and produced independently by the band itself, which now consists of Yuri Deryous (vocals, guitars, keyboards), Walter Aires (guitars), Jean Custer (drums) and Emerson Dylan (bass). 

Currently the band is preparing to do some shows while working on new songs for the next record, which may be released later this year.
