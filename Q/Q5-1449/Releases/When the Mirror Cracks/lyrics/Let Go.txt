	In the darkest hour, tangled with despair
I looked around and I was dreaming
I walk the border of the other side
And all the time a heard a screaming

CHORUS:
Let go let go!
If you want to get back to the place
you were at let go!
Let go let go!
If you tear at your heart
It will rip you apart let go!

And in the mirror I saw a shining light
It beckoned me withz distant hunger
A rage thats burning consumed by itself
I couldnt stop it now or ever.

CHORUS:
Let go let go!
If you want to get back to the place
you were at let go!
Let go let go!
Well he laughs at your pain
Youve got nothing to gain let go!

And when I woke up I had a gun in my hand
I just cant do it
I want this dream to end

CHORUS:
Let go let go!
If you want to get back to the place
you were at let go!
Let go let go!
If you tear at your heart
It will rip you apart let go!
