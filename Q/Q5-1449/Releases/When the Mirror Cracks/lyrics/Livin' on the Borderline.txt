	It never made any difference
I can see what you do to me
I was so empty in love with you.

You always said that you love me
But the words couldnt mean that much
I only know the way you treated me.

CHORUS:
Livin on the borderline,
Livin on the borderline with you.
Livin on the borderline,
Livin on the borderline with you.

You got yourself a new image
And parade it so gallantly
I really tried but didnt understand.

Now it seems much better
If I just turn and walk away
Theres no reason to go on and on.

CHORUS

There always was something
Always was something that got in my way
When I felt your love I never knew
If it was night or day.

There always was something
Something that got in my way
I looked in the mirror and didnt know
If it was night or day.

You never had any reason
For the way you led me to believe
You would always be in love with me.

Now it seems much better
If I just turn and walk away
Ill always know just what you meant to me.

CHORUS
