	Late at night, feeling so right,
all my senses exploding inside
Drivin home, feeling so low 
I cant take it much longer alone
I need you so bad, Ive just got to have
thoughts of you feed my desire
I want to believe when you say that
you need Soon Ill be inside of you

CHORUS:
Well I cant wait
I cant take it
Got to hold you
I cant wait
I cant take it
Got to hold you

You and me passions free
heat running down your sweet skin
Fantasies rage inside a cage
that quivers as Im comin in
Dont take it away, I love how we play
on each others emotions in tune
I need you so bad its drivin me mad
Ive just got to make love to you

CHORUS

Hold on to me Ive come to see the
tenderness locked inside you
Just one more time give me a sign so
I know that youre feeling it too
I wont let go lovin you so,
we only live for each other
I need you so bad its drivin me mad
Ive just got to make love to you

CHORUS
