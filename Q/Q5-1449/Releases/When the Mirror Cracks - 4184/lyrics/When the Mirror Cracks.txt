	When the mirror cracks
guess whos really looking back at you
What an abomination
Dont you people know your race is through

CHORUS:
How can we survive
when everything you hear is just a lie
How can we survive
when everything youre telling us is lies

Does your blood run cold when thinking
that someday you will be old
Faster than the speed of light
those images that run our lives are told

CHORUS

No one knows who runs the show
We dont have time we got to go goodbye
Following the masters voice leading us
to make the choices lies

CHORUS
