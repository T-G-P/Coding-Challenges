	Thoughts about our love have sent me
Higher than Ive ever been before
Can you feel it baby ?
Doesnt matter where you are
Ive got to have you more and more with me
Think about it baby

CHORUS:
I want you to stand by me
Together we can make it happen
Stand by me
Cuz only in your arms I feel it
Think about our life of love Oh God
Ive got to have you stand by me

When a shadow passes by 
Remember all the lies youve heard before
Listen to me baby
I wont try to change you cuz I love you
and what you give to me
Can you feel it baby ?

CHORUS
