	Where are you going now ?
Why do you make me always wonder
What are you feeling now ?`
Do you dream like other people ?

I know you sit and talk about us
And laugh out loud
Why dont you stop and think about it
Or let me out
Of your cold, cold heart

Let me out
Of your cold, cold heart
Cold heart

Why do you walk away
When I ask you what you need and
I want to feel alive
What do you want Ill be there somehow

You always say theres no problem
And then youre gone
Why dont you stop and think about it
Or let me out
Of your cold, cold heart

We can stick around wasting each others time
Playing these games twisting each others minds
Or we can make a stand to be together
I hope that you will stay

Let me out
Of your cold, cold heart
