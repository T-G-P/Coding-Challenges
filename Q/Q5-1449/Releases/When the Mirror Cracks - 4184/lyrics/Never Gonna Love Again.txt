	Is there any reason
Is there any chance
Is there anybody
Isnt there a dance

Why do I feel so helpless ?
What is there left for me ?

CHORUS:
Im never gonna love again
Im never gonna love again

Isnt there a proverb
Isnt there a rhyme
Everything is gone now
Theres no reason why

Why do I feel so helpless ?
What is there left for me ?

CHORUS

I cant hear the birds sing
I cant see the sky
Isnt there somebody
Someone who still cries

Why do I feel so helpless ?
What is there left for me ?

CHORUS
