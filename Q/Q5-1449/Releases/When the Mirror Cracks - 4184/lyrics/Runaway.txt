	Neon lights, line the clouds that haunt your dreams
All alone, steppin out onto the streets
Mothers call, babys gone and cant be found
Comes the night, thats the time it hurts the most

Oh, Runaway you cant hide from the night
Runaway, everybody wants to fight your love

Memories, of a family somewhere crying
Carry on, while inside emotions dying
Children lost, fantasies of days gone by
Runaway, wheres the love you want to find

Runaway memories have grown so cold
Runaway frozen in a heart that feels no love
