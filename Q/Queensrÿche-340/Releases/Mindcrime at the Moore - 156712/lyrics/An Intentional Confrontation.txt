	Where are you now? 
Feeling small. 
Cant live without it? 
You call this your best? 
I made my life a mess. 
And everyone but you sees it. 
What a fool. 
What are you gonna do, 
make more excuses? 
Why dont you tie it off? 
Hang myself? 
End your pathetic little life! 

What is your life worth now? 
Is this what you pictured for yourself? 

Do you understand anything? 

Youre not there yet. 
Youre not anywhere yet. 
Am I closer? 
Go back to your mountain.
