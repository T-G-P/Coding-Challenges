Hamilton, Dr. J HamiltonAll alone nowExcept for the memoriesOf what we had and what we knewEverytime I try to leave it behind meI see something that reminds me of youEvery night the dreams return to haunt meYour rosary wrapped around your throatI lie awake and sweat, afraid to fall asleepI see your face looking back at meAnd I raise my head and stareInto the eyes of a strangerI've always known that the mirror never liesPeople always turn awayFrom the eyes of a strangerAfraid to know whatLies behind the stareIs this all that's leftOf my life before meStraight jacket memories, sedative highsNo happy ending like they've always promisedThere's got to be something left for meAnd I raise my head and stareInto the eyes of a strangerI've always known that the mirror never liesPeople always turn awayFrom the eyes of a strangerAfraid to know whatLies behind the stare [Lies behind my stare]How many times must I live this tragedyHow many more lies will they tell meAll I want is the same as everyoneWhy am I here, and for how longAnd I raise my head and stareInto the eyes of a strangerI've always known that the mirror never liesPeople always turn awayFrom the eyes of a strangerAfraid to know whatLies behind the stare
