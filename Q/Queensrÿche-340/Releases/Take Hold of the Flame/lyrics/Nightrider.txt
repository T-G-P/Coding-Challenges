Beware of night for we all know he's loose againBehind him lies the eyes of mercy and despairForever living out his nightmare comes to lifeFrom hell this spell will find its way to youTonightTonightA thousand cries are heard, they echo in the windAnd still the rider will unleash his chosen sinThe victims of his rage are soldiers of his mindHis scream will heed the call of those who stand behindThe nightrider sails awayThe nightrider sails yeahBy day the rider will have vanished from all eyesSeen from within the only answer to him liesBut as the rays of light begin to fade awayThe rider will return to carry out his stayThe nightrider sails awayThe nightrider sails yeahBeware of the nightBeware of the nightBeware of the nightOh god, beware of the night
