Behind my eyesI keep my truth from you.No one entersthis secret place,the barrier only I embrace.Time is fleeing nowthey say,Take time to look insideand face... the change.Dig down deepto find the man I thought I was.A dog on a treadmill panting,the master pulls the leash, laughing.Now I can't remember whyI needed to run, needed to try so hard.One more time aroundis all I ask for now,a star to seek by, wind totake me home again."Work hard in life boy,there's paradise in the end."Year after year we struggle to gainthe happiness our parents never claimed.They told us all we had to dowas do what we're told, buy what was sold,"Invest in gold, and never get old."One more time aroundis all I ask for now,a star to steer by, wind totake me home again.
