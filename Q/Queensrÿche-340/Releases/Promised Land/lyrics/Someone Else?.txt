When I fell from graceI never realizedhow deep the flood was around me.A man whose life was toilwas like a kettle left to boil,and the water left scars on me.I know now who I am.If only for a while,I recognize the changes.I feel like I did before themagic wore thin and the "baptismof stains" began.They used to say I wasnowhere, man,heading downwas my destiny.But yesterday, I swear,that was someone else not me.Here I stand at the crossroads edge,afraid to reach out for eternity,One step, when I look down,I see someone else not me.Looking back and I seesomeone else.All my life they said Iwas going down,but I'm still standing,stronger, proud.And today I know there'sso much more I can be.From where I stand at the crossroads edge,there's a path leading out to sea.And from somewheredeep in my mind,sirens sing out loudsongs of doubtas only they know how.But one glance back reminds, and I see,someone else not me.I keep looking backat someone else... me?
