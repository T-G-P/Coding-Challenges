Heading for the classroom yesterdayThe kids file through the metal machineIt finds what they may hideNo it just ain't right...A sign of the timesAnother church is burning to the ground...Looking for the vandals and they're nowhere to be foundBut the hate's aliveA sign of the times, Sign of the times...A sign of the times, Sign of the times...(Accoustic Break)Would someone please let me know how we have spun out of control?Has the captain let go of the wheel?Or could we please try to find a way to be a bit more kind?I see the road to tomorrow in the haze!(solo)On the Senate floor they congregateMany pockets lined with green,From those behind the scenes, yeah they take the bribe ( it's on the side )A sign of the times, Sign of the times...A sign of the times, Sign of the times...
