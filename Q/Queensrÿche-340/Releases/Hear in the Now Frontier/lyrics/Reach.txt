I know where I'm going,and I've got all my cards showing.I'm like the crow flies, a straight linereaching for the other sideI dig the sand they kick at me with a calm that stuns.Tracing time with no alibis makes me, makes me realize.It's ok it's just a dream I had.That there's something out there,something, just out of reachArmed with time on my sideand a field of vision miles wide.I'll keep searching for some meaningwhatever makes me feel alive.It's ok it's just a dream I had.That there's something out there,something, just out of reachToday I felt something so strong it took my breath away.Now I longto live like this everyday.I'll find it some way.I'm alive with so much of life to try.I've got no memories of what used to worry me.It's ok it's just a dream I had.That there's something out there,something, just out of reachSomeday I'll reach.It's ok it's just a dream I had.That there's something out there,Something just out of reachjust out of reach, just out of reach
