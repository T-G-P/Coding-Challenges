I opened my eyes,barely alive, without you.Feeling no pain, I'm not the same without you.Save me! Save me!Watching you watchingme from afar, I'm... drowning. Feeling as thoughwe've been here before. Know what I mean?There's a river in your eyes and I'm swept awayBreaking inside out, promising to stayTogether again, a lifetime stranded apartSave me! Save me!Watching you watchingme from afar, I'm... reeling. Feeling as thoughwe've been here before. Know what I mean?But your river calls to me and I'm swept away.Breaking inside out, promising to stayTogether again, a lifetime stranded apartSave me! Save me!
