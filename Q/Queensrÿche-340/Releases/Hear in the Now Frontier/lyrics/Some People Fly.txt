Used to be a timewe held the world.Wrapped 'round our finger tipsLaughing at what others missed. Someday, yesterdayThe magic we felt went away.Grow up somebody said... tell me where it's goneso I can go find it now. I can't live your way.Go ahead without me.I'll find my own waySome people fly... and some of us worry about touchingthe sun with wings. I know if I try I'll get where I'm going,Keeping my eyes on the sky.The box you live within is strong and it's up to youto see beyond the comfort zone you've grown to love.There's more to life than that. The expectationsthat you hold will keep you down and make you oldIf you can't see what I'm trying to say, maybe you justneed to wear my shoes for awhile. I can't live your way.Go ahead without me.I'll find my own waySome people fly...and some of us worryI'd risk it all to have wings.I know if I try I'll get where I'm going,Keeping my eyes on the sky.While you sit there and think about it, there's anotherunfolding their wings. I can tell you what it's like, but,until you try, you'll never see what I mean.Some people fly...and some of us worryI'll touch the sky with my wings.I know if I try I'll get where I'm going,Keeping my eyes on the sky.Keeping my eyes, keeping my eyes on the sky.
