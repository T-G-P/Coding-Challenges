They told me to run, but just how far?Can I go wearing the black mask of fear?The hate in my eyes always gives me awayThe tension building slowlyNow I lost everything I had in youNothing we shared means a thingWithout you close to meI can't live without youBreaking the silence of the nightCan't you hear me screaming?I look for your face in the neon lightYou never answer meThere's no direction to my stareNo more flame burning in my heart anymoreQuiet, I keep it to myselfUntil the sun sets slowlyI hear your voice in the evening rain callingNothing will keep us apartNo more lies and fearThere's no end to our storyBreaking the silence of the nightCan't you hear me screaming?I look for your face in the neon lightYou never answerI could make all the wrong seem rightIf you were by my sideI'd gather all the tears you criedAnd hide them deep undergroundCan't look back, it's just a waste of timeCan't erase this hate from my eyesBreaking the silence of the nightThrough the streets I'm screamingLooking for you in the neon lightWhy don't you answer me?Breaking the silence with my criesCan't you hear me screaming?We could make all this wrong seem rightBut you never answer me
