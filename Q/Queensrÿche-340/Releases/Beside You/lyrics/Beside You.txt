Take your children down to the water wash their heads andsing .. holy holyLast night I dreamed you were standing there, strong andtall beside me.All my life ... behind me.You gently took me by my hand and led me to whereI couldn't see,but where I've always been ... an island.In my dreams I've been an island ...where I'm all alone, and I've built these walls stone bystone.I want to leave but I don't know where to go.I've tried the best I can, but it's hard to be a man andfeel the way you feel.I'm different on the inside. I've tried to give to youwhat you need to get you through.I'll always be ... beside you.The day you were born I held you ... small and helplesscrying, your life and mine entwining.As I looked into your eyes I saw myself in an overview,reaching out to you from this island in the sea.I don't want to be an island.I've tried the best I can, but it's hard to be a man andfeel the way you feel.I'm different on the inside.I've tried to give to you what you need to get you through.I'll always be ... beside you.
