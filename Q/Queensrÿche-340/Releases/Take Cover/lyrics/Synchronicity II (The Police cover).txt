Another suburban family morningGrandmother screaming at the wallWe have to shout above the din of our Rice CrispiesWe can't hear anything at allMother chants her litany of boredom and frustrationBut we know all her suicides are fakeDaddy only stares into the distanceThere's only so much more that he can takeMany miles awaySomething crawls from the slimeAt the bottom of a dark Scottish lakeAnother industrial ugly morningThe factory belches filth into the skyHe walks unhindered through the picket lines todayHe doesn't think to wonder whyThe secretaries pout and preen likecheap tarts in a red light streetBut all he ever thinks to do is watchAnd every single meeting with his so-called superiorIs a humiliating kick in the crotchMany miles awaySomething crawls to the surfaceOf a dark Scottish lochAnother working day has endedOnly the rush hour hell to facePacked like lemmings into shiny metal boxesContestants in a suicidal raceDaddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distanceHe knows that something somewhere has to breakHe sees the family home now looming in his headlightsThe pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs acheMany miles awayThere's a shadow on the doorOf a cottage on the shoreOf a dark Scottish lakeMany miles away, many miles away
