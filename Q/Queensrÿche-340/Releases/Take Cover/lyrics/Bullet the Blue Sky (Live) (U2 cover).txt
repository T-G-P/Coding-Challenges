In the howling wind comes a stinging rainSee it driving nails into souls on the tree of painfrom the firefly, a red orange glowSee the face of fear running scared in the valley belowBullet the blue skyBullet the blue skyBullet the blueBullet the blueIn the locust wind comes a rattle and humJacob wrestled the angel and the angel was overcomePlant a demon seed, you raise a flower of fireSee them burning crosses, see the flames, higher and higherBullet the blue skyBullet the blue skyBullet the blueBullet the blueThis guy comes up to meHis face red like a rose on a thorn bushLike all the colors of a royal flushAnd hes peeling off those dollar billsSlapping them downOne hundred, two hundredAnd I can see those fighter planesAnd I can see those fighter planesAcross the mud huts where the children sleepThrough the alleys of a quiet city streetTake the staircase to the first floorTurn the key and slowly unlock the doorAs a man breathes into a saxophoneThrough the walls we hear the city groanOutside its americaOutside its americaAcross the field you see the sky ripped openSee the rain come through the gaping woundPounding on the women and children who run into the arms of america
