Almost cut my hairIt happened just the other dayIt's gettin kinda longI coulda said it wasn't in my wayBut I didn't and I wonder whyI feel like letting my freak flag flyCause I feel like I owe it to someoneMust be because I had the flu' for ChristmasAnd I'm not feeling up to parIt increases my paranoiaLike looking at my mirror and seeing a police carBut I'm not giving in an inch to fearCause I missed myself this yearI feel like I owe it to someoneWhen I finally get myself togetherI'm going to get down in that sunny southern weatherAnd I find a place inside to laughSeparate the wheat from the chaffI feel like I owe it to someone
