Red rain is coming downRed rainRed rain is pouring downPouring down all over meI am standing up at the waters edge in my dreamI cannot make a single sound as you screamIt cant be that cold, the ground is still warm to touchThis place is so quiet, sensing that stormRed rain is coming downRed rainRed rain is pouring downPouring down all over meWell Ive seen them buried in a sheltered place in this townThey tell you that this rain can sting, and look downThere is no blood around see no sign of painHay ay ay no painSeeing no red at all, see no rainRed rain is coming downRed rainRed rain is pouring downPouring down all over meRed rain-Putting the pressure on much harder nowTo return again and againJust let the red rain splash youLet the rain fall on your skinI come to you defences downWith the trust of a childRed rain is coming downRed rainRed rain is pouring downPouring down all over meAnd I cant watch any moreNo more denialIts so hard to lay down in all of thisRed rain is coming downRed rain is pouring downRed rain is coming down all over meI see itRed rain is coming downRed rain is pouring downRed rain is coming down all over meI'm bathing in itRed rain coming downRed rain is coming downRed rain is coming down all over meI'm begging youRed rain coming downRed rain coming downRed rain coming downRed rain coming downOver me in the red red seaOver meOver meRed rain
