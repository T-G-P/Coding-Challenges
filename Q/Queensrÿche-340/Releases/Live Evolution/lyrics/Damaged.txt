Waiting for the feeling to subside,Paranoid, I melt into myself.They say I'm to reach inside and findthe broken part of my machinery.Psychoanalyze the chapterson the path to my darkest day.Searching for the answers,all I see is damage through the haze.Picking up the pieces of my lifewith no direction for re-assembly.The one that lays beside meis sharing scars of my broken yesterdays.Will tomorrow find me hypnotized? Crying?Mother Mary in control,domineering strangleholdsowing destructive seedsfor the scavengers to feed.Driving the nail into my head,memory flows like a river.With the one that lays beside meI'm healing scars from my childhood memories.Tomorrow finally found me.I'm hypnotized. I'm trying...to understand the chaptersof the path from my darkest day.Searching for the answersbut there's DAMAGE!
