10 P.M., I feel the rain coming downMy face feels the wet, my mind the stormFlashing lights as people race to find shelter from the pourMoving silent, through the streets, they're mine, they'remineMidnite, she sings praises in the HallTo saintly faces hallowed be their names she can't recallSister Mary, virgin Mary, silent with her sin( [Mary:] "What are you doing out in the rain?" )She feels me, I can taste her breath when she speaks( [Mary:] "I've been waiting for you. Come in." )Mary, Mary just a whore for the undergroundThey made you pay in guilt for your salvationThought you had them fooled? Now they've sent me for youYou know too much for your own goodDon't offer me faith, I've got all I need hereMy faith is growing, growing tight against the seamWhat we need is trust, to keep us both aliveHelp us make it through the night[Mary]I've no more want of any faithBinds my arm and feed my mindThe only peace I've ever knownI'll close my eyes and you shootNo Mary, listen, you've got to pull your strength from mylipsI pray I feed you wellYour precious cross is gone, it made me wait so longFor what you gave to everyoneThe priest is cold and dead on his knees he fedFrom my barrel of death, he turned the Holy water redAs he died he said thank youI just watched him bleed[Mary]I feel the flow, the blessed stainSweating hands like fire, and flamesBurn my thighs, spread in sacrificial riteThe hallowed altar burns my flesh once more tonightMary, sweet lady of painAlways aloneBlind you search for the truthI see myself in you, parallel livesWinding at light-speed through timeNo time to rest yetWe've got to stop his gameBefore madness has the final laughToo much bloodshedWe're being used and fedLike rats in experimentsNo final outcome hereOnly pain and fearIt's followed us both all our livesThere's one thing left to seeWill it be him or me?There's one more candle left to light[Mary]Don't turn your back on my disgraceThe blood of Christ can't heal my wounds...so deepThe sins of man are all I tasteCan't spit the memory from my mindI can't cry anymoreMary, my lady of pain, always aloneBlind you search for the truthI see myself in you, parallel livesWinding at light-speed through time, you're mine
