Most of this is memory nowI've gone too far to turn back nowI'm not quite what I thought I was butThen again I'm maybe moreThe blood-words promised, I've spokenReleasing the names from the circleMaybe I can leave here now and, oTranscend the boundariesFor now I'm standing hereI'm awaiting this grand transitionThe future is but past forgottenOn the road to madnessTimes measure rusts as it crawlsI see its face in the looking glass - stopThis screaming laughter hides, the pain of its realityBlack, the door was locked I openedAnd now I've paid that price ten-fold overKnowledge - was it worth such torment, ohTo see the far side of shadowAnd still I'm standing hereI'm awaiting this grand transitionI'm a fool in search of wisdomAnd I'm on the road to madnessYes, I'm on the road to madnessI'm awaiting endlesslyPounding rhythms echo meWon't you take me somewhere far beyond the voidAnd still I'm standing hereI'm awaiting this grand transitionMaybe one day, oh I'll meet you, and we'llWalk the roads to madnessYes, we're on the road to madnessOh, I think they've come to take meI hear the voice, but there's no-one to seeI can't scream, too late it's timeStay on the course to passYou'll never find the answerTo a place where darkened angelsSeemed lost and never foundScream to see the light ofForming figures fast behind youLay the past in the wind to spinAnd your fate will sail beyond the open plainsSail with angels onwardLive or die for the chosen one saidSaber sights cast a spell behind youAnd they lock in all aroundFree the scene insiderNever looking back to find whyRide a course till the end of timeAnd you'll stand atop the gateLaying waste in a path recitedFighting force won't avenge the guided black wingOh, electric might poses fright inside meSeeing light at the end of sight reminds meI've passed away
