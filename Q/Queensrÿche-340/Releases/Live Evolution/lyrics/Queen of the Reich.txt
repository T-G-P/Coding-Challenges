In the dead of nightShe'll come and take you awaySearing beams of light and thunderOver blackened plainsShe will find her wayFlying high through the nightShe will hide your fateAs she takes your soul from underAnd the blinding light of the castle fadesThere is no escapeIt's the ending of your precious lifeYour soul slipped awayIt belongs to the Queen of the ReichThe Queen of the ReichYeah she's coming for youYou're fading awayYour life cast astrayA victim the beast shall obtainThe light will not shineFor you'll die tonight at her shrineAnd black is the last thing you'll seeOver and overDreams of dying fill your headIt's the sign of the crossThat you'll find aheadNo one will answerThe light is fading awayCaptive souls are screaming out in painThere is no escapeIt's the ending of your precious lifeYour soul slipped awayIt belongs to the Queen of the ReichYou're fading away, No, No, NoThe Queen of the ReichYou're slipping away, yeahThe Queen of the Reich
