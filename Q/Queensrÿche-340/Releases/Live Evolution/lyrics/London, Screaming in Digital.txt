It was November 4th I last held your hand.It seemed our time would last forever.You said don't ever leave,I thought you'd never go.I wish I could just remember your name...You're just a memory now like all the ones beforebut with your pain I've had to suffer.Your eyes all night with flame as the picture burns.I hear the screams from long ago.They cry remember, blood-red streakes on velvet throats at night.The streetlights fanned our trail of fame throughLondon, London, the memories will never leave meLondon, London, all I see is youLondon, London, the cries in the night keep bringing me to London,London calling out to meOh, there's some things in life I could never face,the worst is being alone.Sometimes I wish I could have taken your place my love.You know I don't want to live forever.Oh, let me see you standing in the shadows once again.We'll walk the streets like long ago inLondon, London, the fire in your eyes will be bringing me toLondon, London, all I need is you. The cries in the night keep ringing on inLondon, London, calling out to youAll my secrets and I don't know who I am.I even feel alone when you're near 'cause you'll nevr understand.When the first met I must have seemed a million miles away.It's strange how our lives have touched but the time is right.I'll leave tonight, don't look in my eyes'cause you've never seen them so black.I'm the beat of your pulse,the computer word made flesh.We're one you and I, we're versions of the same.When you can see what I feel don't turn yourback on me or you might find that your dreams are only program cards.Your mind is open for me, open for intake of all propaganda.Your eyes see now what to see.My eyes see only the programs you give me.I'll teach you to laugh and to cry,they're really the same you'll see.All of the 's in your life.Are you under my control, feed me more lines.I'll try to tell you all I can before the light you must knowwhat lies behind my screams.I can't tell you all I know.Am I the son that you've always been wanting?There's more to me than what shows.Are you my father, the one that was promisedHush now, I'll give all you need to know and pre-live your dreams for you,you're a good boy.Freedom belongs to only those without video screens for eyes and mouth.You have no voice to be heard my son,no one can hear when you're screaming in Digital.I'm not your slave, you can't control my emotions.No Father, please, let me keep learning.Can't you see I'm human.Can't you tell.I'm not your slave.Oh, Father, no, please, don't keep me from dreaming.Oh can't someone hear!
