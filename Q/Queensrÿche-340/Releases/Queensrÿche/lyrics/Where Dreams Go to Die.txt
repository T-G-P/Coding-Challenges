So here we are again, as we plead upon our knees, this agonizing painSpreading like a new disease, where heroes lay to restWhen we watch our idols fall, a revolution callNow I'm standing in the crossfireNow I'm raising up my fistAnd you'll pay for thisI'll take you there, where castles built will fallWhere dreams go to die and I promise you thisYou thought you'd get away, but Karma made its moveThe bad things that you've done, will be coming back for youIt's really sad that we're at the end, but my heart won't let me feelNo sympathy or pain for the outcome you've ensuedNow I'm standing in the crossfireNow I'm raising up my fistAnd you'll pay for thisI'll take you there, where castles built will fallWhere dreams go to die and I promise you thisAs God as my witness, that your time will finally meet its endYour dreams will burn and die and you cannot resistAdapting model state, symmetry property possessed in varying degrees(Type face that creates, mirror similarities)A way to rise above the meaning, not to exist just for yourselfI'll take you there, where castles built will fallWhere dreams go to die and I promise you thisAs God as my witness, that your time will finally meet its endYour dreams will burn and die
