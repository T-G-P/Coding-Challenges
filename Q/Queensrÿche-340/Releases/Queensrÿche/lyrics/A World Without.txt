Voices whisper in the nightDo you hear them calling meReflecting faces in the lightWhat is real and what is fantasyNowhere to be found, I can't breathe againA mother, my lover, my best friend, my best friendMy baby's staring back at me, and now a broken familyYour name now etched in stone, no place to call my homeYour heart is the amber I see in my dragThe smoke your spirit rising I breathe your loveThe tickle in my throat, your way of reaching outPerhaps the creaking of my doorThe moonlight glistening the shoreNowhere to be found, I can't breathe againA mother, my lover, my best friend, my best friend.My baby's staring back at me, and now a broken familyYour name now etched in stone, no place to call my homeNowhere to be found, (I'm looking down on you)I can't breathe again (or are you looking down on me)A mother, my lover, my best friend, my best friend.(are you looking down on me, I really need to know)My baby's staring back at me, and now a broken familyYour name now etched in stone, no place to call my home
