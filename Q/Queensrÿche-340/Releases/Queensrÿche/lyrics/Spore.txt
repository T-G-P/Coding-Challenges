Executing realms paralyzing scenesMental satisfactions with violent abstractionsPlaying in the dark cutting from a glassNo drop of blood emotions are not turning backA prisoner of war is screaming from the wallNothing is alive only cold and dryI am dwelling in the path seeking for the truthWhat only I reach is just a broken soulTake a look around, in the lost and found, help our fellow manScreams of agony, final destiny waiting for the fallDreams are feeling sick dark pattern in the skinBlind as you can be, you must retreat from the winCrawling in your mind, damaging your sight, take me out of darkness to the lightTake a look around, in the lost and found, help our fellow manScreams of agony, lost eternity waiting for the fallFinal destiny, in an endless sea ride the waves of faith and hope(alternate) "fading...I'm always fading, what's left of me."Take a look around, in the lost and found, help our fellow manScreams of agony, lost eternity waiting for the fallFinal destiny, in an endless sea ride the waves of faith and hope
