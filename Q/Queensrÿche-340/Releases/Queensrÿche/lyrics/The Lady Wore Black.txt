On a lonely walk this morningA light mist in the airDark clouds laughing at me in silenceCasting shadows through my hairIn the distance I saw a womanDressed in black with eyes of greyShe wore her pain like a shackled spiritEternal life was her debt to payThe lady wore blackIt's the sign of the prisoners livesThe lady wore blackSee the years through the tears in her eyesThe lady wore blackHer mystic power calls to meThe lady wore blackHer love can set me freeThe wind song whispered a warningTelling me to bewareOf the quiet shadowed womanAnd of the sadness I would shareWe sat  for sometime together in silenceNever speaking in wordsOf all her thoughts she spoke with her eyesAnd I listened remembering all I heardThe lady wore blackIt's the sign of the prisoners livesThe lady wore blackSee the years through the tears in her eyesThe lady wore blackHer mystic power calls to meThe lady wore blackHer love can set me freeThe words she spoke were of forgotten livesAnd of all knowledge gainedMem'ries I had and didn't know whyWith a smile she explainedI should have listened to the wind's cold warningAnd walked the other wayI touched her soul and now I bear her sentenceBut for her love I'll gladly payThe lady wore blackIt's the sign of the prisoners livesThe lady wore blackSee the years through the tears in her eyesThe lady wore blackHer mystic power calls to meThe lady wore blackHer love can set me free
