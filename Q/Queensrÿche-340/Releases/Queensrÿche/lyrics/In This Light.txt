I've walked for miles down empty roads, todayLighting the way the fireflies, unafraidI try to escape and learn to survive, somehow the rain changed me by surpriseI recognize from the crying sky, the road to nowhere as I follow seems to haunt meI'll break the chains for you but only to remind me, no preservation no paradiseThe pounding of the rain with thunder and its lightingThe storm's reflection like a mirror on my faceWhere did it all go wrong, when will it all go right, somedayI've been searchin' for answers all my life, to rise above a jaded world that seemed to haunt me.I'll break the chains for you but only to remind me, no preservation no paradise
