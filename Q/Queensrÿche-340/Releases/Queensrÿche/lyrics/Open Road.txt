Shades of grey were the colors of my soulAccepted miseries embraced for oh so longThe hands of time sweeping all my dreams awayLost in a circumstantial mazeMoving on to another daySearching for a brighter shade of greyA somber silhouette displays the beauty of a dreamUntil I realized your open eyes in front of meYou color my life with everything you doAnd this open road only leads me back to youMoving on to another daySearching for a better way (a better way)Seek and you will find the cure a blessing in disguise right before your eyes
