The ignorance of youth, the pawns of corporate greedThe raping of our mother earth, no planting of a seedA revolution on the brink, distracted masses writheAnother human born to kill, inherent to surviveHave you seen the vibrant shades of greenOr is your mind a blood red haze which cries and only grievesDon't look back, I won't be standing here...I'm lost but not afraidMarching on beyond the sun, you've gotta free your mind you are the master or the slaveThe innocence and purity consumes the starving childThe mother's pain filled tears they fall, yet still she bears a smileDon't look back, I won't be standing here...I'm lost but not afraidMarching on beyond the sun, you've gotta free your mind you are the master or the slaveYou're in a sea of deceit in a body of liesDon't look back, I won't be standing here...I'm lost but not afraidMarching on beyond the sun, you've gotta free your mind you are the master or the slaveMagnetize what you conceptualize because your thoughts become thingsThis is the Law of Attraction
