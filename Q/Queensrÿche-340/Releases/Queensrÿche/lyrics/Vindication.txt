Look around, on your hi-wire down look down, it's a long way to fallSuicide, the brink of extinct it's over nowThe tables have turned on life's little gameNo longer the pawns you're feeling the strainFor we are all kings with merit it brings, as we rise to the top once againAs you look to the heavens wondering where you went wrongSeeing, not always believing the gavel of life coming downTraces of the past flash before your eyesHurdle the bodies that fed you, the narcissist hungers againFear and control your battleground, your truth under a shroudA forced stranglehold, just do what you're told, as we rise to the top once againAs you look to the heavens wondering where you went wrongSeeing, not always believing the gavel of life coming downSometimes a man's word is all that he's got and sometimes just only a nameNo more suffocation, my true vindication, ascending from all the remainsThis is vindication
