I looked back onceAnd all I saw was his faceSmiling, the needle cryingWalking out of his roomWith mirrors, afraid I heard him screamYou'll never get awayCold and shakingI crawled down alleys to tryAnd scrape away the tracks that marked meSlammed my face into walls of concreteI stared, amazed at the words written on the wallDon't ever trustDon't ever trust the needle, it liesDon't ever trustDon't ever trust the needle when it cries...Cries your nameWet and ravingThe needle keeps calling me backTo bloody my hands foreverCarved my cure with the bladeThat left me in scarsNow every time I'm weakWords scream from my armDon't ever trustDon't ever trust the needle, it liesDon't ever trustDon't ever trust the needle when it cries...Cries your nameDon't ever trustDon't ever trust the needle, it liesDon't ever trustDon't ever trust the needle when it cries...Cries your name
