We see the light of those who findA world has passed them byTo late to save a dream that's growing coldWe realize that fate must hide its faceFrom those who tryTo see the distant signs of unforetoldOh... oh, take holdFrom a haze came a rage of thunderDistant signs of darkness on the wayFading cries scream of pain and hungerBut in the night the light will guide your waySo take hold of the flameDon't you see life's a gameSo take hold of the flameYou've got nothing to lose, but everything to gainRide, to a place beyond our timeReach, for the edges of your mind, and you are thereSee, that the light will find its wayBack to a place where it will stay, make it stayThrow down the chains of oppression that bind youWith the air of freedom the flame grows brightWe are the strong, the youth unitedWe are one, we are children of the lightSo take hold of the flameDon't you see life's a gameSo take hold of the flameYou've got nothing to lose, but everything to gain
