For just one minute, step into my life.Read the page andrun away with me.The day I made that vow.I didn't know then what I know today.There's so much to say.I don't know what the future holdsand I'm sorry if I seemed too cold.A man conflicted in his headmakes poor choices, regrets the words he said.Remember me and all the times we had.The way I held you.Remember me whenever you feel sad.All I want from youis for you to tell me that you miss me.Will you wait for me?Remember me...please.Just wait one minute.  Give me a chanceand I'll make you see just what you reallymean to me.It took a living hell toshow me.  All I want is to be with you.You know that what I say is true.I promise when I get back homeI'll be the man you used to know.And I won't spend another daywithout you, girl.I need your strength.Please stay andremember me and all the times we had.The way I loved you.Remember me whenever you feel sad.All I want from youis for you to tell me that you miss me.Will you wait for me?Remember me.
