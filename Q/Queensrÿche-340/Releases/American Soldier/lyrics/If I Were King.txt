I have so much more to say, my brother.Can you hear me?A fool is left to live as the brave ones fall.I swear if I were able,I would have done the same for you.But now you're gone and I wish I were too.I spend all my time asking questions,How can I pay you back whenthe price you paid was so high, my friends.If I were King of all I imagine,I would trade all I amto have you by my side.If I were King.I have too much time today, my brother.Can you hear me?I know where I am, but I still feel lost.Please know that I am gratefulfor the years you gave to me.Everything's changed, but nothing changesfor you.I won't waste my life asking questions.I've seen the horror of war andthere's so much more for a man who's beenwhere I've been.If I were King of all I imagine,I would trade what I haveto have you back at my side.If I were King of all I imagine,we would both be back homeliving the rest of our lives.If I were King.
