What ever happened to conviction and faith?People trip from side to side; don't knowwhich way or what side to take.Always known the truth.It's really black and white.I've got no fear of judgment when it's time to fight.We shout so loud sothat everyone can hear it.Coming on hard like a head-on collision.Machine like somethingwon't stop won't care.Keep it all down with aHundred Mile Stare.Lieutenant says, "Keep that line of driftno matter what the course!""Drive 'em down the middle all the way!"The heat and the smoke are nothing.The flames from the firesreflect the pride behind our mirrored eyes.It's no surprise.  We don't compromise.Stealing through the night, they'll never know.They'll never see us.Beating on the groundas the people shout "Free us!"Machine like somethingcan't stop, don't dare.Keep it all together with aHundred Mile Stare.We're coming for you!Won't back down!Can't stop us!We unleashthis hell but don't worry.Won't back down, so get ready.I still believe and I can see it...wave!Proud she flies.Call the dogs!  Call out the Dogs!We should so loud sothat everyone can hear it.Coming on hard like a head-on collision.Machine like somethingwon't stop don't care.Keep it all down.Hundred Mile Stare.Stealing through the night, they'll never know,they'll never see us.Beating on the ground as the people shout, "Free us!"Machine like somethingCan't stop, don't dare.Keep it all together with aHundred Mile Stare.
