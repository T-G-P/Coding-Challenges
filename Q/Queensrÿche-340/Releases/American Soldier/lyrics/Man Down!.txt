Hey, I'm okay.Another day, another nightmare begins.And the sound that I hearis the relentless firing in my head.Shifting gear in the driver's seat asthe finger of g'd signals meand this concrete bloodline carries me.Never thought I'd bring the war back home.I'm a number; I'm a casualty of warfor a cause I never had the chance,didn't understand the score.They told me that I'd be okay,assume civilian life, live day to day.But when I think about it my hands still shake,and I know what I am...Man Down!I'm in overdrive, barely alive!As long as I keep moving, I'm all right.Was that a muzzle flash from my pastor just my mind misfiring?With one eye in mirror I seethe 'Cavalry of g'd" coming up on me.Bumper to bumper, traveling fast,waving Satan over...I'm a number; I'm a casualty of war,for a cause I never had the chance,never understood the score.They told me that I'd be okay,assume civilian life, live day to day.But when I think about it my hands still shake,and I know what I am...Man Down!
