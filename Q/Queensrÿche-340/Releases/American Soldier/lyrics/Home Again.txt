It's harder than I thought,to be so far away.So I thought I'd write this letter to you and explain.For me it wasn't easy to raise the flag and leave.But I thought that you should know howmuch you mean to me.I won't be there to see you dance and hearyou sing the songs we love.So please be strong and it won't be long tillI'm home again.You know you make me proudbecause you're the one that I depend upon.And when I return, I promise,I'll never leave you alone again.It's harder than I thought and you're so far away.So I thought I'd write this letter to you and explain.It was only a moment.I turned my head to wipe my eyes andwhen I looked again I saw your smile thatsaid goodbye.Mama says don't worrybecause Daddy's brave and he's cominghome.  But if I could change one thing,I'd never let you go.I want you here to see me dance and singalong to the songs we love.So I'll be strong.  It won't be long till you'rehome again with me.When it feels too much to take,I want you to know that I'm thinking aboutyou, making plans for when I'm home.Why aren't you here?I wake up every night.I check the front porch light,making sure it's shining bright.And I'll be there to shine the lightSo you can find your way to me.I'm feeling strong, but don't take too long.Please come home to me.I'll be there to see you dance and hear yousing the songs I love.It won't be long.It won't be long till I'm home again!Why aren't you here?I'm coming home!
