ALBUM NOTES
Originally recorded as a demo tape in June 1982. The band pressed it on their own label 206 Records as the now-familiar "Queensrche" EP in 1983. When the band signed to EMI Records in 1983, the label picked it up and re-pressed it with the same title.

When the band recorded this EP in 1982, they were not even known as Queensrche. They were actually known as The Mob at the time and featured only 4 out of 5 members. Geoff Tate was the lead singer of a local band called Myth, though he had performed with The Mob on a few occasions, and was asked to join the band for the EP's recording sessions. After Myth broke up, Geoff would become a member of The Mob before they changed their name to Queensrche.

Re-released as a strictly limited 2 CD leather digibook (Cat.-No. 3052182) by the French label Axe Killer Records in 1999 containing this EP and the Operation: Mindcrime album.

Videos were made for the songs Queen Of The Reich and  Nightrider.
