What? You say you're through with me.I'm not through with you.We've had what others might call love.You say it's over now, what's done, what's through?You can't stay away, you need me, I need you.When the fire starts the pain's too much for your mind.You need attention, what's good is only mine.I can cure the hunger that burns in your heart.Just come to me I'll take you home.We'll walk in the shadows by day we'll live in a dream,we'll walk in the shadows.You say you don't feel safealone tonight 'cause you feel the pressure building in your head.Our secret's safe for one more nightbut when the morning comes remember I'll be with you.We'll walk in the shadowsBy day we'll live in a dreamWe'll walk in the shaodwsOne day you'll be with me if only you believe
