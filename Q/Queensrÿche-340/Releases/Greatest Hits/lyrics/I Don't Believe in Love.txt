I awoke on impactUnder surveillance from the camera eyeSearching high and lowThe criminal mind found at the scene of the crimeHandcuffed and blind, I didn't do itShe said she loved meI guess I never knewBut do we ever, ever really know?She said she'd meet me on the other sideBut I knew right then, I'd never find herI don't believe in loveI never have, I never willI don't believe in loveIt's never worth the pain that you feelNo more nightmares, I've seen them allFrom the day I was born, they've haunted my every moveEvery open hand's there to push and shoveNo time for love it doesn't matterShe made a differenceI guess she had a wayOf making every night seem bright as dayNow I walk in shadows, never see the lightShe must have lied 'cause she never said goodbyeI don't believe in loveI never have, I never willI don't believe in loveI'll just pretend she never was realI don't believe in lovev I need to forget her face, I seeit stillI don't believe in loveIt's never worth the pain that you feelNo chance for contactThere's no raison d'etreMy only hope is one day I'll forgetThe pain of knowing what can never beWith or without love it's all the same to meI don't believe in loveI never have, I never willI don't believe in loveI'll just pretend she never was realI don't believe in loveI need to forget her face, I see it stillI don't believe in loveIt's never worth the pain that you feel
