A child alone in daddy's roomThe gun was hidden hereNo one home to catch me when I fallA young man now in a private chairI've seen the world through a bitter stareBut my dream is still aliveI'm going to be the best I canI want to be a busy manI want to see a change in the futureI'm gonna make the best of what I haveI want to write for a magazineI'm gonna be the best they've ever seenI know I'll win if I give it all I canI won't let go, gotta make the gradeNo, I won't let it goTo be the best man, the best man that I canBack street hoop star you've got it goodYou were the wonder of the crumbling neighborhoodNow taking bids on the next six digit planShowed me that my will survivedThe tragedy that came into my lifegiving me hope and the new startthat I haveI won't let go, gotta make the gradeNo, I won't let it goTo be the best man, the best man that I canStep by step I dream the planFrom my chair to walking manThis constant dream is on my mindChase the light I see aheadLuminate the path I treadI live to be the best I canNow I'm moving forwardAnd I'm never looking backStraight ahead, focused on the big attackOn a roll and I'm never slowing downI won't be torn betweenThe man in the chairAnd the man that's in my dreamI'm going to melt the two men into oneI won't let go, gotta make the grade I setNo, I won't let it goTo be the best man,the best man that I can
