	Theres a cold wind out tonight
The chill of distant eyes
An orbit survey finds your mind

I will remember
You will remember
The star that came tonight

Theres a thought that fills your mind
A vision of a time
When knowledge was confined
And then we wonder how machines
Can steal each others dreams
From points that are unseen its real

I will remember
You will remember
The star that came tonight

When you gaze at the evening sky
And youre reaching out with your mind
You might see the nations eyes
Dont hide its you

I will remember
You will remember
The star that came tonight
Oh cant you see the light
Of the knowing star
