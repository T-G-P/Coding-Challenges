Shakin time, she needsTaking rides...to somewhereLets lose our minds, no hurryIm the wakeful night, with dreams...or somethingChasing blue sky,Were chasing blue skyTaking time from all this worryMesmerized by the waves of your smileI wish that I could say somethingBut youre the rose colored glass I see throughIll see you throughChasing blue sky, Were chasing blue skyChasing blue sky, Were chasing blue skyChasing blue sky, Were chasing blue skyChasing blue sky, Were chasing blue sky
