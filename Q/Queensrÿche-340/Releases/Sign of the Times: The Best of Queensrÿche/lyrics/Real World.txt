Strange, the view from hereWords we spoke, forgotten at the timeNow replay in my mindWhat went wrong, what was rightLooking back, I never was there for youYou didn't say, but I know it's trueI can't find the real world aloneEvery time I think I've wonI hear your voice inside, questioningWhere have you goneCan't you remember feeling so aloneYou always had the anwer that I could not seeI can't find the real worldI can't find the real worldI can't find the real world aloneI can't find the real worldI can't find the real worldI can't find the real world alone
