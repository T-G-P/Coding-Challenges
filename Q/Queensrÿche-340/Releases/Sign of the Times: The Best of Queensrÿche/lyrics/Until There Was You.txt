	I reached out and found you,
though youd turned way.
Only we would know.
These careless words I need to define,
were they right or wrong? Only you would know.

If we fall apart now it's the end of me.
Wont ever survive without you next to me.
Theres so much for both of us ahead.

Because its you and me alone,
and Im on my knees here.

I never needed anyone, till I needed you.
I never held a woman, till there was you.
I never saw the light of day, until you.

If Ive said things that hurt you,
then Im sorry. I didnt mean it that way.
This you have to know.

No matter what it seems
to your reasoning, our love is like the sea, washing over me,
moving all around but always remaining.
So Im on my knees.

I never needed anyone, till I needed you.
I never loved a woman, till there was you.
I never needed anyone.


I see it all now, its so clear to me.
Whatever it takes, Ill be there, youll see.
What you gonna do without me anyway?

Because its you and me alone
and sometimes we just cant let go,
of all the pain that we hide.

I never needed anyone, till I needed you.
I never loved a woman, till there was you.
I never saw the light of day.
