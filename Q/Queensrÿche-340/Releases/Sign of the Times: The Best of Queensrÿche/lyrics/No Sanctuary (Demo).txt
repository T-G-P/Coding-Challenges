There's a certain feelingKnown to all who hear the soundThe call of morning risingYou're in a mystic spaceCan't you feel the force embrace, the chill of the windAs it names youOh, can't you see the lies in front of youYour journey ends so far, and still the distanceSpins round and round youNow you cry - give me sanctuaryYou scream but no one listensAgain you cry - give me sanctuaryUntil the end I'll fight and die, to be freeOh! No sanctuaryYou're walking halfway inBut crawling halfway outThere's a void in your mind that you cling toYou feel lost in time, you've got no words to rhymeNo more charms, no more spells to protect youOh can't you see the lies in front of youYour journey ends so far, and still the distanceSpins round and round youNow you cry - give me sanctuaryYou scream, but no one listensAgain you cry - give me sanctuaryUntil the end I'll fight and dieOh I've got to be free
