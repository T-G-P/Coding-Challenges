What? You say you're through with meI'm not through with youWe've had what others might call loveYou say it's over now,What's done, what's through?You can't stay away, you need meI need youWhen the fire starts the pain's too muchFor your mindYou need attention, what's good is only mineI can cure the hunger that burns in your heartJust come to meI'll take you homeWe'll walk in the shadowsBy day we'll live in a dreamWe'll walk in the shadowsYou say you don't feel safe alone tonightCause you feel the pressure building in your headOur secret's safe for one more nightBut when the morning comes rememberI'll be with youWe'll walk in the shadowsBy day we'll live in a dreamWe'll walk in the shadowsOne day you'll be with meIf only you believe...
