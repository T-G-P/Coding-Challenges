Need to know how to get back inside your head..How to leave far behind all the things we saidTrying to see if we can repairall the trust that was born when we walk the lineSave the friendship we said would stand the test of timeJustified how could we end it this way?We don't belong here togetherLosing our hold on the promise we madeCan't we return to forever again?Shadow moves in the room although you're not thereCorner mirror still reflects my redundant stareOver my shoulder I see you againTurn around to reveal you were lying hereTrying to wake me from my broken dreamWe don't belong here togetherLosing our hold on the promise we madeLets walk the long road togetherWe can rebuild once again on our faithCan't we return to forever again?....againNow I'm drifting miles awayon wings from the past I still have..Going to find myself..back to the place we began.. we began........We don't belong here togetherLosing our hold on the promise we madeLets walk the long road togetherWe can rebuild once again on our faithLets start again!....againYa' gotta know..Look to climb back to restart once again..Lets start again!....againYa' gotta know..We can.. build this.. start once.. again..
