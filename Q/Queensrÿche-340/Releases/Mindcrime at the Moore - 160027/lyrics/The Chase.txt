	You think youre smart, inventive 
because youve figured out my game? 
Pride is a handy substitute, 
when youve got only yourself to blame. 
All my dreams Ive realized while you . . . were indisposed. 
While youve spent eighteen years watching TV, 
Ive watched my fortune grow. 

Here I amIm finally on the outside and 
Youre nowhere near where Ive been! 
Ive got you where I want you . . . at last. 
Youve got no idea who I am! 
We circle around each other waiting for reaction 
We circle around each other waiting for reaction 
wanting satisfaction for the past. 
I want nothing . . . from the past. 

Always been so easy youre like a puppet on my string, 
throwing down hollow threats, unsure of what to think. 
Why should I care? 
You wouldnt dare! 
Youre nothing but worthless . . . I swear. 

From where I stand Ive got you where I want you. 
Youll never take me! Never take me down! 
Ive seen all I need to put you in the ground 
Revenge is normal, a typical reaction 
Ive seen your cynical reaction . . . 
if youre standing outside of in. 
always on the outside of in. 

Here we are at last facing oblivion . . . 
And this is where finally it ends. 
You dont belong here. 
holding fast to each of our sins. 
With hope by my side, Ill survive to see the dawn. 
Believe me or not . . . you owe me. 
I owe you nothing! 
I gave your life a purpose! 
I owe you nothing but your death! 
Without me you wouldnt have learned a thing!
