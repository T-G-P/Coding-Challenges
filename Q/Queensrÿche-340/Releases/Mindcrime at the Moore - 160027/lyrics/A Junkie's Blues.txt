	I still have questions with no answers. 
Im alive . . . but Im not living. 

I dont have much time left . . . I just know this: 

Ive lived a violent life. 
I might as well be dead. 

I just want to sleep . . . forever 
and forget . . . 

Its more than physical, love unconditional. 
Everything else is like a Band-Aid. 
Everything will be alright. 

So you cover your bleeding wounds, 
so the dogs wont smell you coming. 
There may be time . . . and 
. . . everything will work out fine. 

But what if it never changes? 
And what if I wasnt to blame? 
And what if it never gets any better . . . than this? 
Everything will be alright. 

What if I wasnt to blame? 
And what if I could change? 
Yeah, what if I could change? 
Everything will work out fine. 

What if youre only . . . ? 

What if Im only insane?
