ALBUM NOTES
Trivia:
-Sequel that continues and ostensibly concludes the story popularized by Operation: Mindcrime.
-Due to conflicts between Geoff Tate and his bandmates, much of the record was written and recorded by Mitch Doran, Jason Slater and a host of other session musicians. 
-The drum track on "I'm American" is actually a MIDI scratch-track Jason Slater mocked up without the intention of making the final mix.
