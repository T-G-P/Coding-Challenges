	She said, Baby, where you been?
Whyd you have to leave me?
Im on the other side . . . just looking in.
Ive been so high; I climbed to the mountaintop,
looked at myself and . . .

Id tell you anything you want to hear.
And Id desert you when Im through.
Id say anything because true love
dont mean a thing to a man, whos not a man, but a fool.

Look at me!
Youre a model of efficiency.
Im always doing what he tells me.
How can you change it now?

Im always looking for it down deep inside,
I thought that this would change my life.
Have you found out?
I remember more . . .
Can you change?
I can change.

For years he must have cried a river of tears.
In his dreams he saw himself . . . a dying man
drawing figures, arrows in the sand.
Mmm, I dont think he understands.
Never thought that it would last forever.
One glance back . . . theres nothing much to say.
He watched as it all began spinning further and further from the truth.

And nothing really matters, when your heart doesnt lead the way.
