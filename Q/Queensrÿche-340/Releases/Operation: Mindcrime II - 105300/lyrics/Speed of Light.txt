	Wonder whered the time go?
There it was, gone in the blink of an eye.
See how much life is left
staring back in my face?
But I know it now as clear as,
clear as a window.

Never thought this day would come,
I never thought Id see.
half my life is gone.
Thought Id never live to see . . .
Never thought this day would come . . .
I never thought Id see half my life is gone
Thought Id never live to be . . . much of anything.

Everything moves faster now.
Were living at the speed of light.
I stand here fascinated,
watching as it all goes by.
Maybe I should live whats left . . . like it was my last.

Never thought this day would come . . .
I never thought Id see half my life is gone.
Id never live to see . . .
Never thought this day would come . . .
I never thought Id see half my life is gone
Id never live to be . . . much of anything.
Everything moves faster now.

Where are you now?
Feeling small.
Cant live without it?
You call this your best?
I made my life a mess.
And everyone but you sees it.
What a fool.
What are you gonna do,
make more excuses?
Dont worry,
Ill kill the bastard!
