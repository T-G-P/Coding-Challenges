	Culture hostage.
Im writhing in the cold grasp of justice,
as she turns away.
Blind is she supposed to be but,
someone took a razor to her mask.

Rusted now the scales you hold,
the balance tipped by the weight of gold.
When will it end?
When will it ever end?

The judgment man holds my fate,
as I beg forgiveness with the
plastic smile of a candidate.

They take for granted that Im out of my mind and theyre wasting their time to care.
So all my reasons are damned before theyre heard.
Im held hostage by their words.
What will lead us to tolerance
if we dont question our prejudice?

Courage is such a lonely word,
patience, in time these truths will be known.
Please, dont keep looking away.
You see fortunes are on line, reputations at risk, and theres fear in the hearts of all of you that believe that youre right,
and thats your right.
But are you . . . right?

The judgment man holds my fate,
as I gaze around the room,
their eyes are like knives, could decapitate.
They take for granted that Im out of my mind and Im wasting their time, dont show, dont show me my fate.

Reasons are damned, cant understand.
If I fall to pieces theyll know . . .
hes out of his mind and hes wasting our time, we know. As I sense my fate . . .
His reasons be damned, cant understand him.
. . . and now all my reasons are damned before theyre heard. Im held hostage by their words.
Im a hostage.
