When I fell from grace I never realizedHow deep the flood was around meA man whose life was toil was like a kettle left to boilAnd the water left these scars on meThe chains I wore were mine, dragging me towards my fatePlanned for me long agoI played by all their rules, went to their right schoolsWho was I to question?They used to say I was nowhere manHeading down was my destinyBut yesterday I swear that wasSomeone Else not meHere I stand at the crossroad's edgeAfraid to reach out for eternityOne step when I look downI see someone else, not meI know now who I am, if only for awhileI recognize the changesI feel like I did, before the magic wore thinAnd the baptism of stains beganSacrifice, the always say... is a sign of nobilityBut where does one draw the line in the face of injury?I'm just trying to understandStanding here at the crossroad's edgeLooking down at what I used to beA drowning man, trying to stay afloatHeavy with the past, but somehow keeping hopeThat there's something more that is seenBut it's somewhere out of reachSo I keep looking backLooking back and I see someone elseAll my life they said I was going downBut I'm still standing stronger proudAnd today I know, there's so much more I can beI think I finally understandFrom where I stand at the crossroad's edgeThere's a path leading out to seaAnd from somewhere deep in my mindSirens sing out loud, songs of doubt, as only they know howBut one glance back reminds and I seeSomeone Else, not me.I keep looking back at Someone Else... me?
