Every time I leave you say you won't be there and you'realways there.Every time I cry your name at night you pull close and sayit's alright.I look in your eyes, just like the rain washing me, rainwash over me.Touching your face, I feel the heat of your heartbeat echoin my head like a scream.What you do to me! Waited so long I can't wait another daywithout you, Jet City Woman.It's a long way, home to my Jet City Woman.I see her face everywhere, can't get her out my mind.Whenever I'm alone I'm thinking there's a part missing frommy life.Wonder where I'd be without your love holding me togethernow I'm watching the time tick,tick away. Face grows longer every day,fortunes are lost on the women I've seen but without you Ican't breathe.You're the air to me! Waite
