What? you say you're through with meIm not through with youWeve had what others might call loveYou say it's over now,What's done, what's through?You can't stay away, you need meI need youWhen the fire starts the pains too muchFor your mindYou need attention, what's good is only mineI can cure the hunger that burns in your heartJust come to meIll take you homeWell walk in the shadowsBy day well live in a dreamWell walk in the shadowsYou say you don't feel safe alone tonightCause you feel the pressure building in your headOur secrets safe for one more nightBut when the morning comes rememberIll be with youWell walk in the shadowsBy day well live in a dreamWell walk in the shadowsOne day you'll be with meIf only you believe...
