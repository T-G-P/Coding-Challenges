In the wooden chairBeside my windowI wear a face born in the falling rainI talk to shadows from a lonely candleRecite the phrases from the wallI can't explain this Holy painSix days ago my life had taken a tumbleThe orders came from high above they sayA need to use me once again they've got my numberFurther the cause boy yes you know the gameI'll wait here for days longerTill the sister comes to wash my sins awayShe is the lady that can ease my sorrowShe brings the only friendThat helps me find my wayI search the past back to a timeWhen I was youngerA target for the new societyPicked to displace the leadersCountering objectivesOf this new underground realityWaiting for days longer'til sister comes to wash my sins awayShe is the lady that can ease my sorrowMy love for herWill help me find my wayMy mission saved the worldAnd I stood proudMy mission changed the worldIt turned my life aroundI look around my room is filled with candlesEach one a story but they end the sameI'll hide away in here the law will never find meThe walls will tell the story of my painWaiting for days longerTill sister comes to wash my sins awayShe is the lady who can ease my sorrowShe sets the pace for my delivery of painThey'll say my mission saved the worldAnd I stood proudMy mission changed the worldThe underground will rise andSave this world we'll all stand proudOur mission changed the world, we'll change the worldWe'll all stand proud
