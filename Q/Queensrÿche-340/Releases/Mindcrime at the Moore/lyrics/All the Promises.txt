Is there some other way out of here?Somewhere I could find myself?Cant sleep enough, cant stay high.All the promises . . . just another lie.Ive always been afraid except . . .in the moments that I loved you.The only time I felt strongwas when you stood next to me.I could make a stand if . . .I could hold your hand again . . .The road Ive traveled is the hard way down,always playing another mans fool.They offered a way insidewith the promise of forgiveness. Its a lie.Could you forgive what Ive done?We had it all, but couldnt see anything,the blind leading the blindthrough the darkest night.When you said you loved meit made me feel alive.When you said you loved me it made me feel . . .like I could fly.Ive always lived afraid except . . .in the moments that I loved you.The only time I felt strong was when you stood next to me.I could make a stand if . . .I could hold your hand again.We had it all, but couldnt see anything,the blind leading the blind throughthe darkest of nights.When you said you loved me it made me feel alive.When you said you loved meit made me feel . . . like I could fly.Ive always been afraid except in the moments
