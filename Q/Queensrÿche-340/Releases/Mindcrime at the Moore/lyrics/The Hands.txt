When Im lost . . . I find a way.I hear voices. I feel them surround me,pull me from the edge.I close my eyes and . . . .my luck keeps holding strong,even when the boot comes down.Waiting for the revolution but theres no one around except the . . . hands out of nowhere, saving me again.Theres always something there watching out for me,if Im suffocating, it gives me air.Finally now I remember,but where Im going now, Im not sure.Only one thing matters much to me anymore.Im looking for you.Can you imagine? You cant think.You wont find a way this time to frighten me.Youre running scared, now, always lookingover your shoulder for a place whereyou dont see my face.But my luck keeps holding so strong,even with the state Im in.Im like a revolution of one, even when I stumble I win.Because theres hands out of nowhere, saving me again.Theres always something there, watching out for me.When Im suffocating, it gives me air.Im like a cat with only a few lives leftand Im crawling through the shadows.Watching my back waiting for the attack that I know iscoming . . . I feel its near.
