	When Im lost . . . I find a way. 
I hear voices. I feel them surround me, 
pull me from the edge. 
I close my eyes and . . . . 

my luck keeps holding strong, 
even when the boot comes down. 
Waiting for the revolution but theres no one around except the . . . hands out of nowhere, saving me again. 
Theres always something there watching out for me, 
if Im suffocating, it gives me air. 

Finally now I remember, 
but where Im going now, Im not sure. 
Only one thing matters much to me anymore. 

Im looking for you. 
Can you imagine? You cant think. 
You wont find a way this time to frighten me. 
Youre running scared, now, always looking 
over your shoulder for a place where 
you dont see my face. 

But my luck keeps holding so strong, 
even with the state Im in. 
Im like a revolution of one, even when I stumble I win. 

Because theres hands out of nowhere, saving me again. 
Theres always something there, watching out for me. 
When Im suffocating, it gives me air. 

Im like a cat with only a few lives left 
and Im crawling through the shadows. 
Watching my back waiting for the attack that I know is 
coming . . . I feel its near.
