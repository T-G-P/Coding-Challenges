Back streets . . . oh hell, back where I started fromtheres not a thing . . . but you.When they took you, when they took you from me and left you bleeding on that concrete floor.One mans obsession is another mans trash,and Mary was more than a whore.And every day I breathe I remember more.Ive become something you wouldnt believe!Ive got this number burned in my brain,a walking nightmare, only slightly insane.They tried to take my fight, almost took my life.They took my truth from me.But when they left me, they didnt know me, cause Im like a lion thats about to roar.Mistakes you make, you take to your grave.And now Im gonna even the score.And every day I live I remember more.I aint got nothing to sell,but its time to pay attention,Im back with one foot in hell.Im back.Theres nothing left but memories hereof something that I didnt begin with.You wanted to believe in somethinguntil the end.Yeah Im like a ghost back from the dead.I need revenge. Gonna have his head.Im gonna finish this and X marks the spot.Im gonna find him give him all that I got.And every day I breathe I remember more.I aint coming at you with something to sell,but you better believe,Im back with one foot in hell.Im back.
