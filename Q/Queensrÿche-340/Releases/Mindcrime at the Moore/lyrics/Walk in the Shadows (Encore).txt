	What? you say you're through with me
Im not through with you
Weve had what others might call love
You say it's over now,
What's done, what's through?
You can't stay away, you need me
I need you

When the fire starts the pains too much
For your mind
You need attention, what's good is only mine
I can cure the hunger that burns in your heart
Just come to me
Ill take you home
Well walk in the shadows
By day well live in a dream
Well walk in the shadows

You say you don't feel safe alone tonight
Cause you feel the pressure building in your head
Our secrets safe for one more night
But when the morning comes remember
Ill be with you

Well walk in the shadows
By day well live in a dream
Well walk in the shadows
One day you'll be with me
If only you believe...
