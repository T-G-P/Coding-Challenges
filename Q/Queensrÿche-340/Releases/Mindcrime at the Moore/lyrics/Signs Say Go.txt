	Imagine if you will, what it means . . . 
this worthless life. 
Tried my best to the scratch the surface 
got bloody broken fingernails. 

Convincing stories of achievement, lies. 
All expectations smashed, never could comply. 
Generations come and go. 
And what will I be, the failure they see here? 

Now, I can't remember! 
All the signs say...go! 
Would I surrender? 
To try to save your soul? 
I can't remember! 
All the signs say...go! 
I'll never surrender! 
Time for heads to roll! 

Do you think Ive got to have 
some good reason? 
The question stands, 
how does he keep getting into my head? 

I know Ill never see. 
Ive got to get free. 
No matter whats said, 
Id rather see him dead! 

You might be wondering why . . . 
I cant take any more? 
I cant take any more. 
Ill tear him down! Im gonna tear him down! 

Ive been called so many things 
Now what do you see? 
A failure dares to dream? 

Now, I can't remember! 
All the signs say...go! 
Would I surrender? 
To try to save your soul? 
I can't remember! 
All the signs say...go! 
I'll never surrender! 
Time for heads to roll!
