Last time, missed my chance but never again.The further away you slip, the more Ill dig in.All things come around againand this time Ill be ready and waiting.You cant imagine dedicationthat I now possess.Theres no one left to save you.Where you run I will follow.Ill step by step re-arrange you.Theres nowhere to hide.Youll never see me coming butyoull feel the fear from my shadow.With intensity, yeah, youll bleed.Before its over youll age ten years older.Time flows like a river . . . deep.Im going to take you down.Theres no one left to save you.Where you run I will follow.Ill step by step re-arrange you.Theres nowhere to hide.They say let the world change youand you can change the world.Theyll bit by bit re-arrange you.I cant change the world.Its taken me years to get to this place.I found you hiding inside a personayou built from my pain.Fortune has finally come andvengeance is mine Ive won.Ill take the world now by storm.Do I let the world change me?Do I lead or follow?Theyll step by step re-arrange me.Let them all try!If I let the world change me,step by step re-arrange me.If I focus on tomorrow,maybe I could change the world!
