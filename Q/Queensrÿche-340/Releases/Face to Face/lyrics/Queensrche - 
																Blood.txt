Thank-you for the lies, the lies you sold us.Thank-you for this vision of violence.Thank-you for this song you gave me to sing.Thank-you for the capping dayof a culture that lay dying.Yes it's us dying.Maybe it won't be long,now that it's all gone on.It's all gone wrong andthere's blood on our hands.We saw them lying therewith their arms around each other,staring through their fear andthe miles between our heads.You could have told the truth.It was your decision tosacrifice integrity and compassion for greed.Now it's all gone wrong andthere's blood on our hands.
