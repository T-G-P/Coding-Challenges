I'm looking backat what just happened,a little bit lost, apprehended.I've made mistakes.Could I say it any clearer?I've not been sleeping,it feels like a week.Our conversations in my headand my body aches.I'm not sure what's real anymore.I'm not sure anymore...and I feel like a passenger on a train.Just watching the world fly by...only a passenger.A little entangled and short of breath,when you look at me that way,you're so hard to resist.I wish I could say what I feel like you...yeah, it's easy for you.What we're going through right now,we need time to understand.There's needs that are differentbetween a woman and a man.But I know I love youas clear as this windowI'm looking though.And I'm just a passenger on this train.Always watching the world fly by,trying my best to explain.Please forgive me if this seemslike some "phase" I'm in.I'm busy watching where I've been.Just like a passenger...I search your eyes but you're not there.I reach for your hand try to pull you near ...mebut you move... away.I feel like a passenger on a train.Always had so much time,never had to explain.There was my lifegone in the blink of an eye.And I feel like a passenger.A passenger.And I feel like a passengeron this train.And I feel like a passenger.A passenger.
