This is not your breakdown,woman raise your head.This is not your madnesseverybody feels this.Woman raise your head.With every feeling in your souland every loss of your control,you can't sleep at night'cause sleeping sometimes drives the pain away.And no matter where we stand,our beginning has no end.'Cause everyday we livewe make it just a little better.This is not our game.We play it just the same.With every move we makewe make it better.Everything's the samenothing slips away.With every move we makewe make it better.Everything that you can giveis the very thing that I would take from you.I'd take from you.With every reason why you liveis every reason I would die for you.I'd die for you.This is not a game.We play it just the same.With every move we makewe make it better.Everything's the samenothing slips away.With every move we makewe make it just a little better.
