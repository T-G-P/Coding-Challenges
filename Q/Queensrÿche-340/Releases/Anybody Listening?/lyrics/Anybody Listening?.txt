You and Ilong to live like the wind upon the water.If we close our eyes, we'll maybe realizethere's more to life than what we have known.And I can't believe I've spent so longliving lies I know were wrong inside,I've just begun to see the light.Long ago there was a dream,had to make a choice or two.Leaving all I loved behind,for what nobody knew.Stepped out on the stage, a lifeunder lights and judging eyes.Now the applause has died and Ican dream again...Is there anybody listening?Is there anyone that sees what's going on?Read between the lines,criticize the words they're selling.Think for yourself and feel the wallsbecome sand beneath your feetFeel the breeze?Time's so near you can almost taste the freedom.There's a warm wind from the south.Hoist the sail and we'll be gone,by morning this will all seem like a dream.And if you don't return to sing the song,maybe just as well.I've seen the news and there'snot much I can do...aloneIs there anybody listening?Is there anyone who smiles without a mask?What's behind the words--imagesthey know will please us?I'll take what's real. Bring up the lights.Is there anybody listening?Is there anyone that sees what's going on?Read between the lines,criticize the words they're selling.Think for yourself and feel the walls...become sand beneath your feet.
