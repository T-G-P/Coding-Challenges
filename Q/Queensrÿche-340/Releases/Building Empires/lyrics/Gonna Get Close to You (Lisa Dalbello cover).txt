I like to look at shadows sweating on the wallI get excited when I hear footsteps in the hallOutside your balcony I have a room with a viewAnd I'm watching youI dial your telephone each and every afternoonI wait by your door till you're asleep at nightAnd when you're alone I know when youTurn out the lightI'm gonna get close to youOh-Oh so close to youI'm gonna get close to youI'm gonna get closeYou fumble for your keysI'm six or seven steps behind youI'm so close to youAre you terrified of me? What do I know about youHow did I find out?You think I'm a fool or maybe some kind of lunaticSay I'm wasting my time but I know what to do with itIt's as plain as black and whiteI'm gonna get close to youOh-Oh so close to youI'm gonna get close to youOh so closeIf you knew my infinite charmThere'd be no reason to be so alarmedMaybe I'm wrong maybe I'm rightMaybe I'm some kind of lunaticYou say I'm wasting all of my timeBut I know what to do with itIt is plain as black and whiteI'm gonna get close to youOh-Oh so close to youI'm gonna get close to youI'm like a hungry Criminaland your protection is minimalSo minimal
