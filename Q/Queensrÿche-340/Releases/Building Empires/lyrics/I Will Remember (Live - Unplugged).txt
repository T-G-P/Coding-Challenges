There's a cold wind out tonightThe chill of distant eyesAn orbit survey finds...your mindI will rememberYou will rememberThe star that came tonight...There's a thought that fills your mindA vision of timeWhen knowledge was confinedAnd then we wonder how machinesCan steal each other's dreamsFrom points that are unseen...It's realI will rememberYou will rememberThe star that came tonightWhen you gaze at the evening skyAnd you're reaching out with your mindYou might see the nation's eyesDon't hide...It's youI will rememberYou will rememberThe star that came tonightOh can't you see the lightOf the knowing star
