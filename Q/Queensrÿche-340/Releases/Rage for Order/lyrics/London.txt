It was November 4thI last held your handIt seemed our time would last foreverYou said don't ever leaveI thought you'd never goI wish I could just remember your name...You're just a memory nowLike all the ones beforeBut with your pain I've had to sufferYour eyes alight with flameAs the picture burnsI hear the screams from long agoThey cry remember, blood-red streaks onvelvet throats at nightThe streetlights fanned our trail of famethroughLondon LondonThe memories will never leave meLondon LondonAll I see is youLondon LondonThe cries in the nightKeep bringing me toLondon LondonCalling out to meOh there's some things in life I could never faceThe worst is being aloneSometimes I wish I could have taken yourplace my loveYou know I don't want to live foreverOh let me see you standing in theshadows once againWe'll walk the streets like long ago inLondon LondonThe fire in your eyes will be bringing me toLondon LondonAll I need is youThe cries in the night keep ringing on inLondon LondonCalling out to you
