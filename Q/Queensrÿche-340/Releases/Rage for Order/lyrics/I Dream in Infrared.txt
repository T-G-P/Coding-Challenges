As you awoke this morningand opened up your eyesDid you notice the tear-stainslining your face were mineDon't you wonder, can't you seewhat's happening to our livesI can't keep living this masqueradeWhen my lonely eyes see only your face at nightI only see in infraredI can't dream anymoreCan't you see I need, tooI can't stand the painYou've gathered all my secretsand I don't know who I amI even feel alone when you're near'cause you'll never understandWhen we first met I must have seemeda million miles awayIt's strange how our lives have touchedBut the time is rightI'll leave tonightDon't look in my eyes'Cause you've never seen them so blackI only see in infraredI can't dream anymoreCan't you see I need toI can't stand the pain
