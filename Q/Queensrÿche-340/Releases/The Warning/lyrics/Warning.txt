I remember I was asking whyAnd someday you said I'd knowAll these years, of fighting hardAnd now it's finally come too closeI can't believe it's now happening to meOh, couldn't it wait a few hundred yearsDestiny can't rest you see, now it's timeTime to cry your tears! Now cry!The child of centuries, forgotten in timeYou talk in circles of rhymeSeer of places future and pastThe warning you gave us is surely our lastWarning!Behold the child, his pointing handIs raised in solemn graceHis eyes once wide with learning wonderNow leave stains upon his faceNow see the hands of the working manHe's leaning back against the wallOnce busy hands are idle nowStanding ready for the fall! Our fall!The signs will come as days past byFor those that claim to seeThe blind will stay not choosing to dieNot believing the visions I've seenWarning!
