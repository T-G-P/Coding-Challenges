Born into darkness in Saturn's sightRiding the night like the windRipping the heart form a world that is rightTreading the borders of sin.Child of fireThe souls that are damnedBy the pain that you bringSend you higherSlashing destruction, your right hand sword ringingTo the ends of the earth you will flyConquering masses in wanton deceptionBlood-red your black flag waves highChild of fireThe souls that are damnedBy the pain that you bringSend you higherLook around, is this the end that you have foreseenThe pain, the misery in us allWhat was it that you knew? Will we one day learn it tooAnd together build another way, to the morningOr will it ever come againYou've poisoned all our hopesWe have nothing now, and what of the childrenWhat has this done to them? Damn you for the painThat they must feelThe last hero standing no time to turn backHe's listening, he waits for your callThe black barren plains reflect the hope of the sameFor one only waiting to fallChild of fireThe souls that are damnedBy the pain that you bringSend you higher
