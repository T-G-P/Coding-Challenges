Back in '86February and a special numberI just had to know, is this feeling real?I picked up the phoneI was one step closer to the danger zoneI knew she'd steal my heart awayBut I know I couldn't live without her loveThe first time she looked at meHer smile stayed on my mindI never thought I'd ever meetA woman of her kindNow I'm lost in a lover's dazeAnd I'm not walking outGonna give my heart awayAnd hope that she will always stayCall for me, run to meWhenever you are lonelyCall for me, run to me my lady loveWon't you come and show me that precious smileAnd maybe stay for a little whileClose the door, Toss the keySay you will always be my one and onlyLooking back it seems to meThe message in her eyesLeft a lasting spell on meA feeling I can't hideNow I'm lost in a lover's dazeAnd I'm not walking outGonna give my heart awayAnd hope she will always stayCall for me, run to meWhenever you are lonelyCall for me, run to me my lady loveWon't you come and show me that precious smileAnd maybe stay for a little whileTreat me to your sense of taste and styleTogether we can walk the milesClose the door, toss the keySay that you will always be my one and only
