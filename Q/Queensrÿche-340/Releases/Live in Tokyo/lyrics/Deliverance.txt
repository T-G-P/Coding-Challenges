Ride swift across the plainDon't you turn back, keep heed in your flameKings with no mercy, this planet at warTorn from enchantment, this land forevermoreBorn from obsession, you cried death for lightYou saw things before and after you diedBack from beyond to rule againBut this life denies you its fight to the endBack from the dawnDeliver us right from wrongKings forge the wayFor your last dayYou search the eyes of thoseWho fear the lawDark and light we all must keep the balance strongOne day a king will rise with the sunThe moon, and the starsAnd you are he and you must die, to beBorn again, come again, once more be again the kingBack from the dawnDeliver us right from wrongKings forge the wayFor your last day
