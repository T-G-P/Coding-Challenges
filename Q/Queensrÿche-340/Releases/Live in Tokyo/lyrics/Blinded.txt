From the night comes a roar of thunderBeholding light on the spell you're underAnd the signs of death descend your wayFighting back from the devil's hungerFreeing souls from their chosen numberAnd the sword of right will guide your wayAnd thus you'll find that only demons fill your mind until you wakeBut only time will tell the answer you've been blinded from todayBurning dreams cause your mind to wonderIron crosses are the calling numbersAnd the fight for the answer still remains oldBut the night will reflect the hungerAnd the blackness will pull you underStill the sword of right will guide your wayAnd in the night you'll hear the voices calling down and they will stayBut only time will tell the answer you've been blinded from today.
