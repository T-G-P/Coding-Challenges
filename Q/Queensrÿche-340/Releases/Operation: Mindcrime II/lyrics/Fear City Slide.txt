	I feel like Im rising,
as everything falls away.
I feel old like the cold wind
blowing outside today.

Got my finger on the trigger and no one cares.
When they find me face down in the river
will they just leave me there?

Hang on, dont let go!
Just hang on! Dont let go!

Come on, come on
gotta take a ride,
Fear City slide.
Last chance @ suicide.

Come on, come on
leave your head outside,
youve built a lie.
Last chance @ suicide.

Come on, come on
lets take a ride!
Last chance @ suicide.

Will anyone remember?
Will they learn from my mistakes?
Sometimes it takes a lifetime of pain to change.

Im closing on the edge here and youve heard it all before . . .
but what good did any of my life bring?
What was it really for?

Hang on dont let go!
Just hang on and dont let go!

Come on, come on
gotta take a ride,
Fear City slide.
Last chance @ suicide.

Come on, come on
leave your head outside,
youve lived a lie.
Last chance @ suicide.

Come on, come on
lets take a ride!
Last chance @ suicide.

Take me to the top of the sky . . . and
let me look down . . .
the long mile down.
When will the darkness end?

Hang on, dont let go!
Just hang on and dont let go!

Come on, come on
gotta take a ride,
Fear City slide.
Last chance @ suicide.

Come on, come on
leave your head outside,
youve lived a lie.
Last chance @ suicide.

Come on, come on
lets take a ride!
Last chance @ suicide.
