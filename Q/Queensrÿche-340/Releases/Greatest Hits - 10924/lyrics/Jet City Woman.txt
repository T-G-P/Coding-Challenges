	Every time I leave you say you won't be there and you're 
always there. 
Every time I cry your name at night you pull close and say 
it's alright. 
I look in your eyes, just like the rain washing me, rain 
wash over me. 
Touching your face, I feel the heat of your heartbeat echo 
in my head like a scream. 
What you do to me! Waited so long I can't wait another day 
without you, Jet City Woman. 
It's a long way, home to my Jet City Woman.
I see her face everywhere, can't get her out my mind. 
Whenever I'm alone I'm thinking there's a part missing from 
my life. 
Wonder where I'd be without your love holding me together 
now I'm watching the time tick, 
tick away. Face grows longer every day, 
fortunes are lost on the women I've seen but without you I 
can't breathe. 
You're the air to me! Waite
