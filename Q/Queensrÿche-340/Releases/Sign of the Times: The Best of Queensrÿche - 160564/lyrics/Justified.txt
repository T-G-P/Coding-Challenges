	Need to know how to get back inside your head..
How to leave far behind all the things we said
Trying to see if we can repair
all the trust that was born when we walk the line
Save the friendship we said would stand the test of time
Justified how could we end it this way?

We don't belong here together
Losing our hold on the promise we made
Can't we return to forever again?

Shadow moves in the room although you're not there
Corner mirror still reflects my redundant stare
Over my shoulder I see you again
Turn around to reveal you were lying here
Trying to wake me from my broken dream

We don't belong here together
Losing our hold on the promise we made
Lets walk the long road together
We can rebuild once again on our faith
Can't we return to forever again?....again

Now I'm drifting miles away
on wings from the past I still have..
Going to find myself..
back to the place we began.. we began........

We don't belong here together
Losing our hold on the promise we made
Lets walk the long road together
We can rebuild once again on our faith

Lets start again!....again
Ya' gotta know..
Look to climb back to restart once again..
Lets start again!....again
Ya' gotta know..
We can.. build this.. start once.. again..
