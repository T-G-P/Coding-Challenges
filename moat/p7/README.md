To execute the code, python 2.7+ is required.

To run tests
$ python python tests.py

To play around with the hash table, you need to instantiate the MyHash class
See tests for examples


Examples:
# In [2]: x = MyHash()
# 
# In [3]: x.set('hello', 'world')
# Out[3]: 'world'
# 
# In [4]: x.get('hello')
# Out[4]: 'world'
# 
# In [5]: x.values()
# Out[5]: ['world']
# 
# In [6]: x.keys()
# Out[6]: ['hello']
# 
# In [7]: x.delete('hello')
# 
# In [8]: x.values()
# Out[8]: []
# 
# In [9]: x.keys()
# Out[9]: []
# 
# In [10]:
