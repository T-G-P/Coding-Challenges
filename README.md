Not-Spamming-Recruiters
==========================

These python scripts are not to be used for spamming emails from a text file

I am personally using this to email recruiters for jobs/internships. 

The benefit of these scripts is that you will receieve a separate thread for each response rather than all of the responses in a single thread. 


Instructions:

If you would like to use these scripts, modify the necessary fields. Also, if you want to use the SendGrid version, you will need a SendGrid account. However, I highly discourage the use of this script for any purpose that could potentially harm mankind. 

These scripts take a tab delimited text file for input and parse the file for valid email addresses and then send an email with an attachment.
