Not-Spamming-Recruiters
==========================

This python script is not to be used for spamming emails from a text file

I am personally using this to email recruiters for jobs/internships. 


Instructions:

If you would like to use this script, modify the necessary fields. Also, if you want to use the SendGrid version, you will need a SendGrid account. However, I highly discourage the use of this script for any purpose that could potentially harm mankind. 

These scripts take any tab delimited text files for input and parses the file for valid email addresses and then send an email with an attachment.
