seeI'd give it all that I've got to make it go awayNothin' can change what's been done nor what we do or sayI can feel it coming how it's crawling up from insideLess time now in between to recover and there's nowhere that I can run or hideI wish that I could scream and shout out really smash all things up in my realmTo let go of my regrets and anguish but tell me how to smash one real bad dreamOnce again I have found myself awake in the nightAnd the days I spend thinking of something happening way back in timeI regret and keeping on having to hurt fills me with frightWhat is killing me slowly just won't go out of my mindFor the lights have gone out..."}}, {"Deep": {"length": "05:32", "number": 20, "lyrics": "Well, I can still recall the first time that I first laid my eyes on youI can't believe all the years that have passed sinceOr just how little we then knewBut as the ways of fate would have it well in the end we sure did meetI am a man so high on this feeling I feel like dancing in the streetsI'd hoped you somehow would have always knownThough I know I would let it showI can't believe this is really happeningPlease someone punch me and ask me what day we have todayWhat day we're having todayI'm sure that I would not reply coz I would not if I was dreamingStill this feels good to be a lieCoz when I look deep into your big brown eyesIt's like a flash outta clear blue skyAnd then that gentle smile when your eyes meet mineIt's like I loose all sense of timeOh, how I wished for all these years, how I've longedHow out of place all words will seem at timesIt's like we don't need to talk at allI get off quite allright from just looking into your eyesFrom looking into your eyes from just looking into your eyesIt feels like I could surely flyIt happens every time you're near meThis feels so good it must be rightCoz when I look deep...Oh, how I've wished...I can't believe I've wished I'd diedThat was before that you had called meThis feel so good it must be

dates and names and placesGreat deal of women I have knownBut as I sit here and remember all the things that I've been throughIt appears to me quite clear now how one thing always remained trueI have a gift that have make me wonders to write and sing a songIt pulled me through a lot of hard times and probably will do so for quite longTwo continents I've travelledI've made a million friendsI've talked to press, tv and radioI've been exhausted, joyed and bored beyond senseI have recorded things I've written great deal of albums I did sellI've done what many only dream ofIt's been sheer heaven mixed with just a little hellI've seen my face on the covers of the magazinesWe go through many different stages in our life though short it isWe take on symbols sounds and faces but in the end you're all there isThis is me playing and me singing it's for you all to either love or hateBehind this leather and my dark shades there's a heart that's far from a fakeBefore you critisize please

Your own Last Judgement...The lesson of fate.Mors inevitabilis est, et hora ejus incerta.So be responsible for your actions,And choose to repent or not,For as lords or as serfs,There will be only one outcome.Unequal in life,But all equal in Death.Decide your destiny,But remember that you will go the way of all flesh.Memento mori..."}}, {"Quintessence -

The shaman healsThe oldest and strongest emotion of man is fear.And while they ponder what could have been done they could be doing.Ages old man has longed for death.Leaving this world there is to come another.Invoke the forms of higher knowledge to bestow the fallen way beneath the cloak of the nightsky.Conjurer of depth perception.  Freedom from the chains of man. The masses droning, the demons calling.Energy is liberated as the witching hour approaches,a vital move as we must become one.We shall see when arriving there.How much the sense deceives itself by distance.And if achieving struggle by exception.The pendulum swings as the hour approaches.One would have thought evolved and elite.The message is clear as the cloudless night.No hope in humanity.  Its deeds mark the signs.Inevitable end.

His new home became the lighthouse, old and torn but beautiful.Now he always sits by his house and looks out over the sea.He had always loved the sea and it hadn\u2019t taken his life.III.

He breathed the air so cold andfresh and put his pipe gently in his mouth. The grass was green,the sky was blue, lonely he was as he stood against the wall.He took up his fiddle and started to play.The bird came down and whispered in his ear.The bird\u2019s whisper \u201cAelin my friend, do you rememberthose days when you were young and set course out to sea?A very long time has now gone by, the sorcerer is gone and no-oneknows where he is.

His fiddle\u2019s tunes echoed away,carried by the breeze (the eternal wind of the sea).IV. Over the seaHe had to find a man strong enough to sit all time watching overthe sea. To be the island\u2019s guarding angel, a sentinel with pureheart and soul. On this island they\u2019ve always had a lighthouse-keeper to deliver them from evil. And now Aelin was old so hehad to go away and find a new one.On the fourth day he set sail. Said farewell to the people, whowished him luck on the trip. They put some leaves on his boatto please the weathergods. The winds were strong this morning,the tide was right and nothing could go wrong. Suddenly hedisappeared with his boat beyond the horizon.When Aelin arrived in Calabor he went to a tavern to end histhirst. He opened the door and entered the room.

This is only a dream to makeyou understand that life serves a purpose. You live and learn\u2026and follow your destiny.\u201dAelin \u201cI understand what you mean. Take me out of this dream. I will comehome to you again. My parents are soon gone, we must go a visit them.\u201dV. Awakening \u2013 Dream to reality\u2013 Instrumental \u2013VI. Home againThe journey back to reality was long. It was night whena flash of light woke him. The snow began to fall, winterhad come, he looked around and suddenly he saw land.He sailed towards the nearest harbour. Now he couldgo and meet the sorcerer. He heard birds singing songs,reflections of ancient past. And his fiddle\u2019s tunes echoedaway, carried by the breeze (the eternal wind of the sea)."}}, {"Aelin's Oath": {"length": "09:28", "number": 7, "lyrics": "I. The light appearedAelin \u201cI\u2019m looking for a man, he\u2019s a sorcerer all dressed in white.I wonder if you my friend have seen him? He is waiting for me.\u201dAn old man spoke \u201cI think I saw him a few days ago. He rode a snow-white horse. You must go to the seven hills beyond the forests and plains.\u201dNow he went to the town and traded his boat for a horse that could carryhim far. He rode one day, he rode one night and finally he saw seven hillsbeneath the sky. He rode towards the hills and found the sorcerer sitting bya warm fire. Aelin sat down on the other side and looked deep into his eyes.Aelin \u201cI have found myself now, and I am ready to follow you. I can see the trueheart of magic inside of me. But before we continue with the sorcery we must goto Alonvar. I want to see my parents one more time.\u201dThey looked upon a rising sun that began to bring light to they day.Sorcerer \u201cThen we must go to The Mighty One where I will teach youtrue sorcery. Remember Aelin, that it\u2019s still a long way to go to win the powersthat can keep the light of life shining on our world.\u201dBefore they rode away Aelin took an oath.\u201cThe light of life will keep shining bright.\u201dII. Epilogue \u2013 The last journeyThey arrived safely in Alonvar, and went to the housewhere Aelin was born. He said goodbye to his parentsforever. He knew that time was short.Hand in hand they went down to the harbour where theirship was waiting. Wind in hair and with tear-stained eyeshis parents were left all alone (again).When they sailed away their ship suddenly rose above the sea.With the wings of a dream they were carried away by the breeze.And Aelin\u2019s last words echoed awayas they sailed to The Land Of Eternity."}}]}, "parsed": 1}], "id": "58633", "name": "Quicksand Dream"},

Geoff Tate was the lead singer of a local band called Myth, though he had performed with The Mob on a few occasions, and was asked to join the band for the EP's recording sessions. After Myth broke up, Geoff would become a member of The Mob before they changed their name to Queensr\u00ffche.Re-released as a strictly limited 2 CD leather digibook (Cat.-No. 3052182) by the French

descend your wayFighting back from the devil's hungerFreeing souls from their chosen numberAnd the sword of right will guide your wayAnd thus you'll find that only demons fill your mind until you wakeBut only time will tell the answer you've been blinded from todayBurning dreams cause your mind to wonderIron crosses are the calling numbersAnd the fight for the answer still remains oldBut the night will reflect the hungerAnd the blackness will pull you underStill the sword of right will guide your wayAnd in the night you'll hear the voices calling down and they will stayBut only time will tell the answer you've been blinded from today."}}, {"The Lady Wore Black": {"length": "06:15", "number": 4, "lyrics": "On a lonely walk this morningA light mist in the airDark clouds laughing at me

whispered a warningTelling me to bewareOf the quiet shadowed womanAnd of the sadness I would shareWe sat  for sometime together in silenceNever speaking in wordsOf all her thoughts she spoke with her eyesAnd I listened remembering all I heardThe lady wore blackIt's the sign of the prisoners livesThe lady wore blackSee the years through the tears in her eyesThe lady wore blackHer mystic power calls

to the wind's cold warningAnd walked the other wayI touched her soul and now I bear her sentenceBut for her love I'll gladly payThe lady wore blackIt's the sign of the prisoners livesThe lady wore
