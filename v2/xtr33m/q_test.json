Why being so afraid? Will they witness the end? Is the Apocalypse coming? How much time is left?  So many useless questions, No clue, no answer. The original sin, The only cause of Death. Time to have a rest, Near this old cross. An ancient calvary, In the middle of this lost place.  This is when the falcon flew away from them, So high in a red sky, towards the sunset. Diverted from their habits, What could have bothered them? Suddenly, before their eyes, The most nightmarish vision ever.  Then one raised his arms to the sky, The other put his hands on his chest, The last one tried to turn back."}}, {"Annthennath - An Encounter with the Dead": {"length": "06:57", "number": 2, "lyrics": "Three dead standing there, Rotting corpses in front of the lords, Wearing tattered shrouds, Armed with scythes, bows and arrows.

Hominem te esse momento!\"  The decomposed bodies began to talk, Claiming that no apostles will save the living, No saints can stop the hourglass, As life is transient.  An instruction Beyond affliction, An instigation To an act of contrition.  A lesson and warning to prepare to die at any moment, The wheel of Fortune can make the powerful and vain ones fall.  Profane or religious, the message from beyond the grave remains the same, An earthly existence is empty, with forms of morbidity, Crime, execution, disease, battle, suicide, Death is insensitive and its scythe will cut the brittle thread of life.  A dreadful encounter with the dead, And everything seems so futile."}}, {"Annthennath - The Lesson of Fate": {"length": "07:46", "number": 3, "lyrics": "What we were, you are ; what we were, you will be!

Even kings can become as hideous as we are, It is useless to blame the Grim Reaper's wicked ways and Hell.  Life is precarious, foresee your ineluctable end.  You believe that the original sin caused the loss of Paradise and man. You believe that Christ died but defeated Death with eternal life.  Your own Last Judgement... The lesson of fate.  Realize it is already too late to flee as all men are doomed. Realize your passage on earth is brief before your last breath.   Your own Last Judgement... The lesson of fate.  Mors inevitabilis est, et hora ejus incerta.  So be responsible for your actions, And choose to repent or not, For as lords or as serfs, There will be only one outcome.  Unequal in life, But all equal in Death. Decide your destiny, But remember that you will go the way of all flesh.

He never rested on their journey to his house, where Aelin would grow up and gain knowledge of the ancient ways.  Clouds cover the lands but soon the sun will shine again. The time is right, now when day and night unite.  After a year they finally reached the sorcerer\u2019s house. The house of wisdom stood in a clearing near the sea.

Another day and night went by and the sorcerer mourned. But he thought that he could do something to make Aelin understand that he was the chosen one to be a sorcerer. That it was his destiny.  Aelin \u201cDo you think you can stop me from sailing away?\u201d Sorcerer \u201cMaybe I cannot do so, but I have plans for something else.\u201d  Wiser and wiser as time marched on.

You\u2019re standing before the parting of ways. Soon the night is here and the years have passed. Aelin, which way will you go?\u201d  Aelin \u201cI\u2019ve decided to go on an eternal voyage to ancient places beyond the light of day. My love to the waters is stronger than ever, I will sail the seas and never return again.\u201d  Sorcerer\u2019s wrath \u201cSo step into the waters if you believe your spirit will be purified. You only try to hide from your destiny if this is what you decide.\u201d  The silver moon went up high like birds do in the spring. The rain fell like tears while the sorcerer closed his eyes. Eagles where flying across the mountainside. The wind was moaning outside his house. And he often searched in wonder why Aelin chose that way.  Sorcerer \u201cThe road goes ever, ever on, farther than the eye can see. Beyond the well-known lands for you and onward to eternity. The road Is long, the road is hard and once you reach what you are looking for, you turn your head and look upon a new day\u2019s dawn, a rising sun.\u201d  Aelin \u201cI want to be one with the sea. Let my spirit be the tide, and with my breath the waves shall arise. I will sail away and let the laws of nature take my life. You\u2019ll have to find another one to be your chosen one.\u201d  Sorcerer \u201cThe road for you my friend will go far and wide. The powers that I gave you aren\u2019t enough to hold you from the sea. It isn\u2019t hard for me to see that the end is near. Now you must go, I cannot change it, it\u2019s too late\u2026\u201d  Aelin stood gazing across the sea when the sorcerer came and looked into his eyes. Aelin spoke with pride in his voice \u201cI will rule the sea when my spirit is free.\u201d  He prepared a boat to take him away, to sail far and wide until his dying day. And as the spring came with the caress of love, the sun went up high and lit his way.  He set his course and sailed away, but after some time there was no food left. And soon after that no water to drink, so he faded away out there on the sea."}}, {"The Lighthouse Dream": {"length": "16:00", "number": 6, "lyrics": "I. Fading away \u2013 Into the dream \u2013 Instrumental \u2013  II. On the shore There was a man on the shore. He had drifted far from his home, and the waves took him higher and higher up on the beach.  The people of the little island took care of him because he hadn\u2019t died. His new home became the lighthouse, old and torn but beautiful.  Now he always sits by his house and looks out over the sea. He had always loved the sea and it hadn\u2019t taken his life.  III. A sunny day \u2013 Many years later The sun rose and in the horizon he saw a ship sailing the sea. And the only sound was a bird in the sky, and the waves softly caressed the stones on the shore. He breathed the air so cold and fresh and put his pipe gently in his mouth. The grass was green, the sky was blue, lonely he was as he stood against the wall.  He took up his fiddle and started to play. The bird came down and whispered in his ear.  The bird\u2019s whisper \u201cAelin my friend, do you remember those days when you were young and set course out to sea? A very long time has now gone by, the sorcerer is gone and no-one knows where he is. The people of the island took care of you, but remember that your life doesn\u2019t last forever. Your time has come and you have to find a man who can take your place here.\u201d  Aelin spoke \u201cThey saved me once and for that I will be grateful all my life and ever after it. In four days from now I will sail away because I have grown old and my beard is two feet long. But here can find him?\u201d  The bird said \u201cGo to Calabor, on the other side of the sea.\u201d  The bird flew away and left him alone by his lighthouse out there by the sea. His fiddle\u2019s tunes echoed away, carried by the breeze (the eternal wind of the sea).  IV. Over the sea He had to find a man strong enough to sit all time watching over the sea. To be the island\u2019s guarding angel, a sentinel with pure heart and soul. On this island they\u2019ve always had a lighthouse- keeper to deliver them from evil. And now Aelin was old so he had to go away and find a new one.  On the fourth day he set sail. Said farewell to the people, who wished him luck on the trip. They put some leaves on his boat to please the weathergods. The winds were strong this morning, the tide was right and nothing could go wrong. Suddenly he disappeared with his boat beyond the horizon.  When Aelin arrived in Calabor he went to a tavern to end his thirst. He opened the door and entered the room. The people stopped talking, turned their heads and stared. He looked at the crowd when suddenly he saw a man dressed in white walking towards him.  The man said \u201cGreetings my friend, do you remember me?\u201d  He was the sorcerer from the land of eternity. They sat down talking and Aelin told about the man he was looking for.  Sorcerer \u201cNow you are in search of someone, just like I was a long time ago. I searched and found you, but you chose your own way. This is only a dream to make you understand that life serves a purpose. You live and learn\u2026and follow your destiny.\u201d  Aelin \u201cI understand what you mean. Take me out of this dream. I will come home to you again. My parents are soon gone, we must go a visit them.\u201d  V. Awakening \u2013 Dream to reality \u2013 Instrumental \u2013  VI. Home again The journey back to reality was long. It was night when a flash of light woke him. The snow began to fall, winter had come, he looked around and suddenly he saw land. He sailed towards the nearest harbour. Now he could go and meet the sorcerer. He heard birds singing songs, reflections of ancient past. And his fiddle\u2019s tunes echoed away, carried by the breeze (the eternal wind of the sea)."}}, {"Aelin's Oath": {"length": "09:28", "number": 7, "lyrics": "I. The light appeared Aelin \u201cI\u2019m looking for a man, he\u2019s a sorcerer all dressed in white. I wonder if you my friend have seen him? He is waiting for me.\u201d  An old man spoke \u201cI think I saw him a few days ago. He rode a snow- white horse. You must go to the seven hills beyond the forests and plains.\u201d  Now he went to the town and traded his boat for a horse that could carry him far. He rode one day, he rode one night and finally he saw seven hills beneath the sky. He rode towards the hills and found the sorcerer sitting by a warm fire. Aelin sat down on the other side and looked deep into his eyes.  Aelin \u201cI have found myself now, and I am ready to follow you. I can see the true heart of magic inside of me. But before we continue with the sorcery we must go to Alonvar. I want to see my parents one more time.\u201d  They looked upon a rising sun that began to bring light to they day.  Sorcerer \u201cThen we must go to The Mighty One where I will teach you true sorcery. Remember Aelin, that it\u2019s still a long way to go to win the powers that can keep the light of life shining on our world.\u201d  Before they rode away Aelin took an oath. \u201cThe light of life will keep shining bright.\u201d  II. Epilogue \u2013 The last journey They arrived safely in Alonvar, and went to the house where Aelin was born. He said goodbye to his parents forever. He knew that time was short.  Hand in hand they went down to the harbour where their ship was waiting. Wind in hair and with tear-stained eyes his parents were left all alone (again).  When they sailed away their ship suddenly rose above the sea. With the wings of a dream they were carried away by the breeze.  And Aelin\u2019s last words echoed away as they sailed to The Land Of Eternity."}}]}, "parsed": 1}], "id": "58633", "name": "Quicksand Dream"},

The band never liked the song but their producer at the time persuaded them to cover it to make a single and the recording heard on the \"Metal Health\" album shows the first time the band played the song, without any previous rehearsing. Following the success of the single however, it became a staple of their live set.  Quiet Riot officially disbanded on September 19, 2003, but reformed with a new lineup in October 2004.  On Sunday, November 25th of 2007, Kevin DuBrow was found dead in his Las Vegas home of a cocaine overdose. It has been reported that DuBrow died about six days before his body was discovered. Frankie Banali announced in January 2008 that Quiet Riot had disbanded permanently.  In September 2010, Banali reactivated the band with the final touring members before DuBrow's death and new vocalist Mark Huff.", "years_active":

States", "description": "For Geoff Tate's version of the band, see Queensr\u00ffche.  The band originally started in 1981 as The Mob, and their line-up consisted of guitarists Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton, bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott Rockenfield. Vocalist Geoff Tate was in another local band, Myth (and upon his departure was replaced by Razor Baby singer Brent Young).  Tate had performed with The Mob on a few occasions, and was asked to join the band for the EP recording sessions. After leaving Myth, Geoff became a full-time member of The Mob, and the band changed their name to Queensr\u00ffche towards the end of 1982.  Queensr\u00ffche kept their original line-up until their 1997 album \"Hear in the Now Frontier\", after which guitarist Chris DeGarmo left the band. He contributed to their 2003 album \"Tribe\", but never rejoined.  Kelly Gray is more well-known for being a producer for non-metal bands than his time in Queensr\u00ffche (although he did a widely-panned job of producing Nevermore's 2003 \"Enemies of Reality\" album).  Queensr\u00ffche were briefly detained in Amsterdam on 11/06/2006 for being suspected of secretly bringing a firearm into the country - it was, in fact, only a prop used in their stageshow.   In 2012, Michael Wilton, Eddie Jackson and Scott Rockenfield, along with live guitarist Parker Lundgren, formed a band called Rising West with Crimson Glory singer Todd LaTorre to perform lesser-heard Queensr\u00ffche songs from the band's early days.  After a couple of shows as Rising West they fired Geoff Tate from Queensr\u00ffche and announced they would be continuing with LaTorre and Lundgren as permanent members.  In response, Tate assembled a line-up featuring Queensr\u00ffche alumnus Kelly Gray as well as Rudy Sarzo, Bobby Blotzer and Glen Drover (who swiftly departed without playing any shows), and also performed as Queensr\u00ffche until April 2014, when the legal battle over the rights to the band's name was resolved. As part of the agreement, Tate now has exclusive rights to perform the two \"Operation: Mindcrime\" albums onstage in their entirety, but will no longer record or perform as Queensr\u00ffche.",

forgotten lives And of all knowledge gained Mem'ries I had and didn't know why With a smile she explained I should have listened to the wind's cold warning And walked the other way I touched her soul and now I bear her sentence But for her love I'll gladly pay  The lady wore black It's the sign of the prisoners lives The lady wore black See the years through the tears in her eyes The lady wore

We were sitting there, Seemed like hours Pass the day away, Till they said we had to pay, Or do the dishes or something, I don't know. Living at the plaza Athenee, Got to rest for the show. Man at the front desk knew my face. Said he had a room with a view for two. But he forgot to say, Renovation next door starts today. Can't fing another room. All day long they banged, 14 hours. Show time on my mind, And wringing somebody's throat,  Last time in Paris Last time in Paris Last time in Paris was strange Last time in Paris Last time in Paris Last time in Paris was strange  Overslept, missed the bus to the show Had to find my own ride. Took the metro out to Avingnon. Man at the backstage, didn't know my name. Said hey, I'm with the band! You and everyone today. What is this guy new? 15 minutes fly, Someone sees me. Inside let me go  (Hey Geoff, we need photos Before the show!)

I can't live your way. Go ahead without me. I'll find my own way  Some people fly... and some of us worry about touching  the sun with wings. I know if I try I'll get where I'm going, Keeping my eyes on the sky.  The box you live within is strong and it's up to you to see beyond the comfort zone you've grown to love. There's more to life than that. The expectations  that you hold will keep you down and make you old If you can't see what I'm trying to say, maybe you just need to wear my shoes for awhile. I can't live your way. Go ahead without me. I'll find my own way  Some people fly...and some of us worry I'd risk it all to have wings.

I can tell you what it's like, but, until you try, you'll never see what I mean.  Some people fly...and some of us worry I'll touch the sky with my wings.

We take the money and we run We take the money and we run"}}, {"Circles": {"length": "03:40", "number": 31, "lyrics": ""}}, {"Walking on Holy Water": {"length": "06:13", "number": 32, "lyrics": ""}}, {"Bloody Fool": {"length": "03:24", "number": 33, "lyrics": "I got some tickets for a Rock \u00b4N\u00b4 Roll Show I had to hitch a ride The queue stretched out for miles And miles and miles, miles Curtain came down, music was loud It drove me out of my head Atmosphere was electric I got a heart attack Oh what a night, what a good night What a good night, for Rock \u00b4N\u00b4 Roll Oh what a night, what a good night - What a good night!
